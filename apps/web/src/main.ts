/**
 * Sentry is initialized before Angular bootstraps so framework errors are
 * captured through Angular's ErrorHandler, not only uncaught browser errors.
 * The SDK remains a dynamic import when no DSN is configured.
 *
 * THROUGH ./app/core/sentry-lazy, NOT '@sentry/angular' DIRECTLY. A dynamic
 * import retains the imported module's entire namespace, and @sentry/angular is
 * `export * from '@sentry/browser'` — so importing the package here ships
 * rrweb, the feedback widget and the profiler to reach four symbols. Measured
 * 2026-09-08 with ng build: 460,113 B raw / 152,367 B gz that way, 151,343 B /
 * 51,235 B gz through the re-export module. Destructuring in a .then() does NOT
 * fix it (the bundler cannot use a runtime property access). The chunk is lazy
 * either way and never counts against the initial budget, but it IS awaited
 * before bootstrapApplication, so it is a round trip the student waits through.
 *
 * Both the import and init() are guarded: a chunk that fails to load (a stale
 * index.html after a deploy) or an init that throws must cost telemetry, never
 * the app. Before this, a 404 on the SDK chunk rejected bootstrap() and the
 * student got a blank page.
 *
 * Rule 1 applied to telemetry, browser half: sendDefaultPii off, logs and
 * metrics off (they default to ON from 10.71.0 and bypass beforeSend), no
 * Session Replay (see environment.ts for why), and the three hooks from
 * telemetry-scrub as the last stop before anything leaves the machine.
 * tests/test_codebase_guards.py (apps/api-py) reads this file as text.

/**
 * Reveal the icon font only once it has actually loaded.
 *
 * Material Symbols draws its glyphs from LIGATURES: the markup says
 * `<span class="icon">chevron_left</span>` and the font turns that text into an
 * arrow. When the font does not arrive — a blocked or slow font host, an offline
 * client, a strict CSP — the browser renders the ligature text instead, and every
 * icon in the product becomes the literal word "chevron_left", "school",
 * "task_alt". Buttons stretch, the sidebar wraps, and the UI reads as broken
 * rather than as degraded.
 *
 * `.icon { visibility: hidden }` in reep-v2.scss is the default; this adds
 * `fonts-ready` to <html> only when the font is genuinely available, so a failed
 * load leaves a blank space where a glyph would be. Every icon in this app is
 * decorative (aria-hidden) and sits beside a real text label, so a missing glyph
 * costs nothing while a stray word costs the layout.
 *
 * Three ways out, in order: the font reports itself loaded; the Font Loading API
 * is missing entirely (very old browser — reveal, since we cannot tell); or the
 * check has not resolved within a second and `document.fonts.check` says the face
 * is there anyway. If the font truly never loads, the class is never added.
