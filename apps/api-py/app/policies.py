# DIRECTOR IS NOT HERE, AND THAT IS THE POINT (2026-09-10).
#
# REEP has one office account: the Main Admin (ADMIN). DIRECTOR was a second
# admin under another name — its baseline was every console screen — and nothing
# has been able to create one since `app.grant_access` began refusing it. It
# survived only in the dev seed and in these role sets, which meant a row that
# could no longer be minted still opened every door if one existed.
#
# The enum value stays on `users.role` (dropping a Postgres enum value with any
# historical row is a destructive migration for no gain), but it now grants
# NOTHING anywhere: the migration that came with this change converted every
# DIRECTOR row to MENTOR and bumped its `token_version`, so no live session
# carries the claim either. `tests/test_no_director_privilege.py` pins it.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    `allow_handover` — B9.1's 90-day window, AND WHY IT IS A KEYWORD
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    This function gates THIRTY-SIX call sites and FIFTEEN OF THEM ARE WRITES:
    adding and deleting mentor notes, resolving alerts, reviewing uploads and
    skill claims, approving badge evidence (which MINTS an EARNED badge),
    manual awards, recording capability assessments, six notebook mutations.
    It has no idea which it is serving — a branch that returns the student
    returns it to a POST exactly as readily as to a GET.

    So the handover cannot be a branch that is simply "on": that would turn a
    90-day READ into a 90-day right to write about a student who is now
    somebody else's. It is a parameter, it is keyword-only, it defaults to
    FALSE, and it is passed True at GET call sites only. Every existing caller
    keeps today's behaviour exactly, and opening the window for a write is
    something a person has to type on purpose.

    WHAT IT CHECKS IS A GRANT, NOT THIS TABLE'S `to_at`. `app/mentor_history.py`
    mints a `mentor.mentees` grant scoped to the one student with a 90-day
    expiry when a mentee is released, and `holds_handover_for` asks whether that
    grant is live. Reading the window off `mentor_assignments.to_at` instead
    would leave the door open after an administrator revoked the grant in
    Governance, which is two sources of truth for one permission.

    THE GRANT MUST NAME THIS EXACT STUDENT. `holds_handover_for` refuses to use
    `reaches_target`, which a PROGRAMME-WIDE `mentor.mentees` grant satisfies
    for every student alive — see its docstring. Rule 2 and the capability fence
    are checked separately on purpose (app/governance.py: "a capability can
    never relax the student filter"), and this is the one place where a careless
    reading would collapse them.

    IT ALSO REACHES A STUDENT'S RECORDED VOICE, and that is worth naming rather
    than discovering: `routers/interview_records.py`'s audio download goes
    through this gate. It carries a second `admin.interview_audio` check, which
    a MENTOR holds only by an explicit grant, so a handover alone does not open
    it — but the next person to relax that second check should know this one is
    behind it.
