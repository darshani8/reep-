"""The faculty account, from the day it is created to the day it is switched off.

B3.1 - B3.6. What is pinned here, and what breaks if each assertion goes:

  * a faculty account cannot be created without a DEPARTMENT, because the
    department is how it reaches its college, and the college is what fences the
    address and scopes every grant made on the person. Delete that assertion and
    an admin mints tenant-less accounts again;
  * an address off the college's domains is refused unless the admin says so in
    writing, and the words they wrote land in the audit row. Delete it and a
    typo in a domain puts a REEP account on an address the institution does not
    control - which is a roster row, and the roster is the access control;
  * the address can be corrected, and doing so checks uniqueness (two rows
    answering one address is an account takeover with no attacker in it) and
    signs the account out (the cookie carries `email` as a claim);
  * DISABLING shuts every door from ONE place and keeps every record. Delete the
    "still 200 on someone else" half and the next refactor turns offboarding
    into a global outage; delete the "notes survive" half and it turns into a
    delete;
  * the Main Admin and your own account cannot be disabled, or the console locks
    every human out of the only screen that could undo it;
  * enabling restores the LOGIN only. Delete that and a colleague's capability
    grants come back on the word of whoever pressed the button;
  * sign-out-everywhere retires every device from either side without touching
    the password - the first move while the facts are unclear.
