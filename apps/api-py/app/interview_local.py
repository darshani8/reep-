"""The LOCAL interview engine — the same interview, with no API key.

    browser  <--WS /api/interview-->  THIS PROCESS  ---> nothing leaves it

app/interview_nova.py sends 24 kHz PCM to Amazon Nova 2 Sonic and gets speech
back from one model that hears, reasons and speaks. That model has no local
equivalent, so this module rebuilds the same behaviour out of three pieces that
do: faster-whisper hears, an Ollama model reasons, Piper speaks.

WHY IT IS A DROP-IN AND NOT A REWRITE. `LocalSession` takes the constructor
that `_RelaySession` takes and returns what `run()` returns, so the router
chooses between them on one setting and everything around the engine is
untouched -- consent, the concurrency limiter, turn writes, the finalizer, the
recorder and the three-layer session close all keep working because none of
them ever knew which engine was speaking.

More importantly it emits the SAME downstream events. The browser handles the
OpenAI Realtime event names (`input_audio_buffer.speech_started`,
`...transcription.completed`, `response.created`, `response.done`) plus the five
`reep.*` controls, so this engine synthesises those names from its own pipeline
and the Angular client needs no change at all. The event vocabulary is the
contract; where the audio was produced is an implementation detail.

WHAT UPSTREAM USED TO DO FOR FREE, AND NOW HAS TO BE BUILT:

  voice activity   A speech-to-speech model tells you when the student started
                   and stopped. Here that is an RMS gate with a hangover, below.
  turn taking      There is no server VAD to commit a turn, so `_Vad` deciding
                   silence IS the end of the turn.

Everything ABOVE the audio is unchanged and deliberately shared with the relay:
the phase machine, `classify_answer`, and `build_instructions` all come from
app/interview_matrix.py. A student sitting the local interview is assessed by
the same arc, the same word-count gate and the same instructions as one sitting
the hosted interview. If those two ever diverge, the scorecards stop being
comparable and the whole record becomes untrustworthy.

RULE 1 (AGENTS.md) is satisfied here by construction rather than by a gate:
nothing leaves the machine, so there is no egress to allow or refuse. That is a
stronger guarantee than the relay's, not a weaker one -- but it is not a licence
to compose student records into the prompt. The instructions are the same fixed
strings for the same reason they are there: the moment student text enters an
instruction string, the next editor puts a resume in it.
