"""B2.7 — the audit log, read back.

    GET /api/admin/audit              the filtered page
    GET /api/admin/audit/export.csv   the same query as a spreadsheet (audited)
    GET /api/admin/audit/{id}         one event, with its before/after pair

THE ROWS ALREADY EXIST. `architecture_events.record_change` has been writing
`redesign_audit_events` from nineteen literal call sites — twenty-seven
endpoints once the three `_audit` wrappers in swoc.py, interview_bank.py and
admin_students.py are expanded — since the Phase 4 additive models landed. What
was missing was any way to read them: the only instrument for "who revoked that
grant" was `psql`. This is the reader, and it adds no column and no table.

APPEND-ONLY, AND IT STAYS THAT WAY. There is no write endpoint here and there
must never be one: an audit trail a console can edit is not an audit trail.
`retention.py` has never swept the table, and `purge_people.VERDICTS` and
`purge_students.STUDENT_VERDICTS` both say KEEP for it — they used to EMPTY it,
which meant handing a deployment over erased the record of who had done what to
it. `tests/test_audit_api.py` pins all three so the verdicts cannot drift back.

WHY THIS IS MAIN-ADMIN-ONLY RATHER THAN SCOPED, which is not what
04-backend-changes.md says. The spec asks for the list to be "scoped by B1.2 for
college admins", and B1.2's `policies.scope_filter` is real and works — but it
narrows by the institutional spine (college → department → course →
specialization → batch → student), and an audit row carries NONE of those. Its
only tenancy column is `tenant_id`, which is nullable, and nothing in `app/` or
in `migrations/` has ever inserted a `TenantMembership` or set it: every row in
the table is NULL and always has been. A scope filter written against it would
be a join that compiles, returns everything for the Main Admin, nothing for
anybody else, and reads at the call site as though scoping were solved.

So the honest implementation of "scoped" today is "the office alone", and that
is what this does. When audit rows start carrying a college — the row would need
it stamped at write time by `record_change`, not inferred later, because the
ancestry of an entity at the moment it was changed is not recoverable from the
entity's current row — `_gate` below becomes the one line that changes.

`_gate` is also where `admin.governance` arrives. B2.6 adds that capability in
this same phase; it does not exist in the catalogue yet and this module must not
invent it (`require_capability` raises ValueError on an unknown key, which would
turn every request here into a 500). One line, one swap, one place.
