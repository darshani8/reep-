"""On-disk store for interview audio — a SIBLING of app/platform/document_store.py, never a reuse of it.

Interview Engine v3 §8.4 argued, at length and correctly, that audio should not
be captured in that pass. The product owner has since required a stored
recording for authorised developer review of the interview engine, so this
module is the "later pass" §8.4's closing paragraph sketches. Every one of its
four objections is answered HERE, in code, rather than waved off — and the
answers are the reason each design decision below looks paranoid:

1.  **"There is no encoder."** True of Opus and irrelevant to WAV. The bytes
    already crossing the relay are PCM16 LE mono 24 kHz, which is exactly the
    payload of a RIFF/WAVE file; the stdlib `wave` module writes the 44-byte
    header around them. No dependency, no transcode, and NOT ONE CPU CYCLE of
    encoding on the audio path — `feed()` is a list append.

    `wave.Wave_write.writeframes` also re-patches the RIFF size fields after
    every call (unlike `writeframesraw`), so the file on disk is a PLAYABLE WAV
    at all times, not only after a clean close. A worker killed with -9
    mid-interview therefore leaves a shorter recording rather than a corrupt
    one. That property is worth the per-flush seek and is the reason nothing
    here reaches for the private `_patchheader`.

2.  **"48 kB/s, 43 MB an interview, 4.3 GB/hour at the 100-session cap, on a box
    with no quota."** Those are §8.4's numbers for SPEECH-ONLY capture and the
    timeline doubled them: both tracks now advance at wall-clock rate whether or
    not their speaker is talking, so it is 96 kB/s and ~86 MB for the longest
    interview `interview_max_seconds` permits, plus the derived mix again on
    top. Do the arithmetic against 96,000 whenever you size anything here — the
    byte cap was left at a figure computed from 48,000 for a release, and it
    silently cut 3.8 minutes off every full-length interview. Three answers, in
    order of how much they save:
    `settings.interview_recording_enabled` is FALSE by default, so the usual
    deployment stores nothing at all; `settings.interview_recording_max_bytes`
    is a HARD per-session ceiling after which capture stops and
    `audio_truncated` is set — never a silent truncation; and every file is
    destroyed by `retention.purge_expired` through `delete_session_audio`
    below, on the same 180-day clock as the transcript. "Every file" is meant
    literally: retention sweeps by SESSION ID, for every expiring session,
    never by what the row believes about its own audio — a row's flags record
    what the relay managed to write down before it died, and the filesystem is
    the authority on which files exist.

3.  **"document_store.py cannot be reused — it decides type by magic bytes and
    accepts only PDF/PNG/JPEG, and admitting audio loosens the one control that
    makes it trustworthy."** Also correct, which is why document_store.py is not
    touched, not imported here, and not taught about audio. This store has its
    own root directory, its own naming rule and its own validation. What IS
    carried over is its hardening, because those lessons were paid for once:
    reads and deletes reject any path separator or `..`, no client-supplied
    string ever becomes a path component, and the store is the only code that
    knows where the bytes live.

    ONE DELIBERATE DIVERGENCE. document_store names files randomly because their
    names come from a student; ours are named for the `interview_sessions.id`
    that owns them — a server-generated uuid4 hex that no client ever supplies,
    and still validated on the way in. The reason is deletion: if the row's
    `audio_path` is ever lost (the finalizing UPDATE failed, a migration went
    sideways), a recording of a named student would become undiscoverable and
    therefore undeletable. Naming the file after the session means retention can
    always find it from the row's primary key alone.

4.  **"Voice is biometric-adjacent — a different consent and legal posture."**
    The strongest objection, and the one with the least forgiving failure. So:
    NO BYTES ARE WRITTEN unless `settings.interview_recording_enabled` is true
    AND the student holds a live `interview_consents` row, of the current
    version, whose `scope_store_audio` is true. Both gates are in `recorder_for`
    below and it is the ONLY constructor callers should use. The consent check
    fails CLOSED — an unreachable database means "do not record", never "record
    anyway".

WHERE THE BYTES COME FROM AND HOW THEY LEAVE THE LOOP. `feed()` is called from
the relay's audio hot path (~25 frames/s/session in each direction) and NEVER
does I/O: it appends to an in-memory list and returns. A flush is scheduled as a
task only once ~256 kB has accumulated (~5 s of audio), and the write itself
runs on `asyncio.to_thread` — the same discipline every other blocking call in
this feature uses, and the reason a slow disk cannot stall a live interview's
audio. Buffering rather than a dedicated writer thread per session is deliberate:
at the 100-session cap a thread apiece would be 100 OS threads blocked on a
queue, while `to_thread` reuses the executor the relay already has, and it keeps
one concurrency model in a module that is hard enough to reason about with one.

The buffer is bounded (`_MAX_BUFFERED_BYTES`). If flushes fall so far behind
that the bound is reached, capture STOPS and the truncation flag is set — it
does not skip a chunk and carry on. A file with a hole in the middle is a
recording that replays as if the student went quiet; a file that simply ends is
a fact the flag already describes.

SILENCE IS COUNTED, NOT BUFFERED, and that is not an optimisation — it is the
fix for a recording that ended itself. `feed()` queues a pending pad as an
INTEGER segment in the track's buffer and materialises it only in the writer,
in bounded blocks. Materialising it on the hot path instead made padding a
first-class consumer of a buffer sized for speech: a track only pads when it is
NEXT FED, so a 90-second student answer left the interviewer owing 90 seconds
of silence, and the next question pushed it as ONE 4.3 MB `bytes()` — over
`_MAX_BUFFERED_BYTES`, which stopped capture and blamed the disk. "Tell me about
yourself" runs 90 to 120 seconds, so the FIRST QUESTION of a real interview
could end the recording, and the log line sent whoever investigated to check a
healthy disk. The pad is still CHARGED to the byte cap the instant it is owed
(see `_push`) — deferring the charge would stop the cap bounding disk.

THREE FILES PER INTERVIEW: one per speaker, plus a MIXED listening copy — and
the two per-speaker files are still the record.

§8.4's refusal to mix was right about the format it was looking at and wrong
about nothing else, so read it before you touch this. Its argument was that the
uplink and the downlink are not time-aligned, and under the ORIGINAL `feed()` —
which appended only the bytes it was handed — that was not merely a risk, it was
arithmetic. A real interview produced a 141.3 s session holding a 51.7 s student
track and a 116.7 s interviewer track: 168.4 s of audio in 141.3 s of wall clock,
because each file was a speech-ONLY concatenation with every silence squeezed
out. Laying those two against each other puts the student's answers underneath
the wrong questions, which is exactly the invented fact §8.4 refused to publish.

What changed is that the files now carry a TIMELINE. The recorder takes one
monotonic stamp at construction, and `feed()` pads the gap between where a track
SHOULD be on that timeline and where it actually is with zeroed samples before
appending the real audio (see `_gap_bytes`). Both tracks are padded to the
session's full length at close. Each file is therefore session-length, both
start at the same instant, and mixing them is a sum rather than a guess. The
product owner asked for one file "like a phone recording", explicitly over a
stereo L/R variant, and this is what makes that answerable honestly.

The alignment it can promise, stated plainly so nobody over-reads it: each track
is aligned to WHEN THE BYTES REACHED THE RELAY. For the student that is their
microphone, within a network hop. For the interviewer it is when the model's
audio was forwarded to the browser — which the student heard a play-queue later,
and which the model may have emitted FASTER than real time in a burst. So the
interviewer's track can run ahead of the wall clock during a long answer and
falls back into step during the next silence (a negative gap pads nothing and
never trims — see `_gap_bytes`). The mix is accurate to a beat, not to a frame.
That is a listening copy for a reviewer, and it is why it is DERIVED: the two
per-speaker files are never regenerated from it, are still served by `?track=`,
and are the thing to reach for when the question is "what exactly did the model
send". Do not "clean up" the sources.

    IDEMPOTENT — a file that is already gone is success. The reaper runs again
    tomorrow and a second pass must not start raising.

    A NO-OP FOR A SESSION THAT NEVER RECORDED — including one whose store
    directory does not exist, which is every deployment with
    `interview_recording_enabled` false. `unlink` on a missing file and `unlink`
    under a missing directory both surface as `FileNotFoundError`, and both mean
    the same thing here: nothing of this student's is on that disk. Nothing in
    this function creates a directory (see `_store_root`), so calling it for a
    session that never had audio leaves the filesystem exactly as it found it.

    RAISES ONLY WHEN BYTES MAY STILL BE ON DISK — a name we refuse to resolve, a
    permission error, a device that is gone. Retention holds the database row
    back from hard-delete when this raises, because a row is the last pointer to
    a recording of a named student: destroy it and the file becomes
    undiscoverable, which is the one outcome nobody can fix afterwards.

    Both the recorded path AND the session id are tried, and they are usually the
    same string. `audio_path` defaults to None because the session id alone IS
    enough — it is the file's name, which is the whole reason §8.4's naming rule
    diverges from document_store's. Pass the row's path anyway when you have one: the
    two differ exactly when the finalizing UPDATE failed and the row never
    learned its path, and a caller that thinks about that case is a caller who
    will keep passing it if the naming rule ever changes.

    THE HOLE THIS USED TO DESCRIBE IS CLOSED. Retention once selected rows by
    `audio_recorded OR audio_path`, so a file whose row learned NEITHER — Layer 1
    died before it could record what it believed — was never offered here at all.
    `retention._delete_interview_audio` now calls this for EVERY expiring
    session, which is why the "no-op for a session that never recorded" property
    above is a contract and not a convenience: it is what makes an unconditional
    call cheap enough to be the only sweep this store needs.

    forgives — it is a burst of white noise exactly where both people were
    talking, which is the moment a reviewer most wants to hear.

    NEITHER SIDE IS HALVED. Attenuating both tracks by 6 dB would guarantee
    headroom and would also make a quiet, nervous student — the one this
    recording exists to review — inaudible under a model that is always at a
    confident level. Overlap is rare (people take turns), clipping is rarer
    still, and a moment of clipping is a better trade than an interview you
    have to strain to hear.

    Unequal lengths are handled by treating the short side as having gone
    silent, so a truncated or one-sided capture still mixes.

        Without this the shorter track simply ends, and two files that started
        together but end minutes apart are no longer a pair a reviewer can drop
        into an editor and trust. The mixdown below tolerates unequal lengths —
        it treats a finished track as silence — so this is about the SOURCES
        staying honest about the interview's shape, not about making the mix
        work.

        NOT done when capture was already stopped. A truncated recording ends
        where the cap or the disk ended it, and padding it out to the session
        length would dress a truncation up as a student who went quiet, which is
        the exact lie `audio_truncated` exists to prevent.

        A track that never received a byte is NOT padded into existence either:
        an interview where the student never spoke still leaves no student file,
        for the same reason nothing is opened until the first byte is flushed.

        THE CAP IS SPENT ON BOTH TRACKS AT ONCE, and that is the correction to a
        version that recomputed `remaining` INSIDE the loop: `student` comes
        first in SOURCE_TRACKS, so it ate whatever was left and `interviewer`
        got the crumbs — one closing session measured 43,200,044 B against
        20,800,044 B, from a function whose entire promise is that the two end
        together. Levelling both to the same reachable point is the only answer
        that keeps that promise when the cap binds.

        AND A SHORT LEVEL IS A TRUNCATION. The old branch reasoned "no audio was
        lost, only silence" and left the flag clear. That reads to a reviewer as
        a complete recording, and it is not one: it is shorter than the
        interview, so the last thing on it is not the last thing that happened.
        `audio_truncated` is how this module says "there is more interview than
        there is file", which is exactly the fact here.
