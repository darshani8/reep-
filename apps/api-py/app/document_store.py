"""Hardened on-disk file store for student uploads.

Bytes live on disk under a random `stored_name`; only metadata goes in the
`uploads` table (see models/upload.py). Two rules the Next.js store also enforced
and that matter for trusting a student-supplied file:

- The type is decided by MAGIC BYTES, not the client-sent name or Content-Type.
  A ".pdf" that is actually an executable is rejected; the recorded mime is what
  the bytes actually are.
- The name written to disk is random, so a crafted filename can never traverse
  the store or overwrite another file. Reads reject any separator in the name.

Only PDF / PNG / JPEG are accepted — the formats a mentor reviews (marksheets,
certificates, photos). Max 10 MB, matching the UI copy.

Per-file is not per-student: see MAX_UPLOADS_PER_STUDENT / MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES_PER_STUDENT
below for the quota that stops one account filling the disk 10 MB at a time.

    that any second writer must repeat the check. There are now three writers.
    routers/staff_upskilling.py re-implemented the check; routers/alumni.py did
    not. An invariant that lives in the caller is a convention, and a convention
    is one new endpoint away from being false.

    So the LIMITS and the ARITHMETIC live here, and `save_bytes` will not store
    a byte without one. The COUNTING still belongs to the caller, because it
    needs that owner's table (`uploads`, `staff_upskilling_certificates`), and
    this module stays free of the ORM -- which is what lets it be tested with
    four integers and no database.

    Two phases, and the order is the point. `check_slot()` runs BEFORE the
    request body is read, so an owner who is already over their file count never
    gets their megabytes buffered into this process at all; `check_bytes()` runs
    after, when the size is finally known. A single combined check would have to
    read first, which is exactly the denial-of-service the count cap exists to
    stop.

    The default is ``attachment``, and that is a security posture, not a UX
    choice: everything this store serves is a user-supplied file, and the SPA
    and API are same-origin by design. A PDF rendered INLINE runs its embedded
    JavaScript in that shared origin — uploaded by one student, opened by the
    mentor reviewing it — and the magic-byte sniff cannot help, because the
    payload IS a valid PDF. `attachment` hands the bytes to the browser's
    download UI instead of its renderer. Pass ``inline=True`` only for content
    this server authored itself (the interview WAVs, whose container
    interview_audio.py writes).

    Starlette encodes header values as **latin-1**. Interpolating a student's own
    filename straight into this header therefore raises UnicodeEncodeError inside
    Response.__init__ -- before any handler code can catch it -- the moment the name
    contains a character outside that range. At a Bengaluru college that is not a
    hypothetical: a file named "ಪ್ರಮಾಣಪತ್ರ.pdf" uploads perfectly and then 500s on every
    download attempt, which reads to the student as "my certificate is corrupted".

    RFC 6266 exists for exactly this. Emit BOTH parameters:

    * ``filename=``  an ASCII-only fallback, for clients that predate RFC 5987.
    * ``filename*=`` the real name, UTF-8 percent-encoded, which every current
      browser prefers when present.

    Quotes and control characters are stripped from the ASCII fallback rather than
    escaped. A CRLF in the fallback would be a response-splitting attempt; today
    uvicorn's h11 layer rejects such a header itself, but that is a defence borrowed
    from a dependency, and it would evaporate under a different server.
