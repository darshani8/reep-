"""B11.3 — writing seating rules, which is writing the thing that mints accounts.

WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE MODULE FROM `test_registration_rules.py`. That one is
pure: it constructs a transient `RegistrationRule` and asks `_rule_matches` what
it decides, with no database anywhere. Everything here needs a real session, a
real capability grant and a real spine to hang a rule on, so it is marked
`@requires_db` and kept apart rather than making the pure module conditional.

WHAT THESE TESTS ARE ABOUT. A rule with `auto_approve` and a batch is the one
control in the product that seats a student without a human, and it is now
typed into a form. So the tests are named after the failures that form could
produce: a pattern that takes the public endpoint down, a wildcard that approves
everybody, a rule written into a college the author cannot reach, an edit that
moves one out of reach, and a delete that quietly unlinks the applications it
routed.
