/**
 * Tailor to opportunity — step 2 of the resume flow.
 *
 * Takes the posting chosen in the goal strip and says three things: whether the
 * student can actually apply, which of the role's requirements are still
 * missing (and where each claim stands), and which essential sections of the
 * resume are still empty.
 *
 * THE ELIGIBILITY LINE IS THE POINT. A student with a 90% skill match on a
 * posting whose CGPA cut-off they miss is not eligible, and a screen that
 * printed "90% match" and nothing else would read as an invitation. So the
 * verdict is rendered first and separately from the score, with the server's own
 * `reasons` listed verbatim — a missing requirement is named, not implied.
 *
 * Both numbers come from GET /student/jobs. Nothing here recomputes a match; a
 * second opinion that disagreed with the Jobs screen would be worse than none.
 * The guidance below it reflects the student's CURRENT verified skills, so
 * nothing on this step overstates their eligibility.
