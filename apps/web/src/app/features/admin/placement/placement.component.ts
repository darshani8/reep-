/**
 * Placement & offers — the funnel for a batch and the offer decisions behind it.
 *
 * The approved board is `docs/redesign-2026-09/design/admin/Placement.html` and
 * the brief is `02-admin-console-spec.md` §15. Four decisions in this build are
 * worth reading before changing it.
 *
 * THE FUNNEL DRAWS THE STAGES THE PAYLOAD COUNTS, AND THE PAYLOAD NAMES THE
 * REST. The board's funnel is six stages of DISTINCT STUDENTS — eligible,
 * applied, shortlisted, interviewed, offer received, placed. B12.3 made four of
 * them real (`eligible`, `applied`, `offered_students`, `approved_students`),
 * and it did NOT invent the fifth: `interviewed` comes back `null` with its
 * reason in `unavailable[]`, because nothing in REEP records a recruiter's
 * round and the mock interviewer's sessions are rehearsals a student can sit
 * four times in an afternoon. THE SCREEN RENDERS THAT LIST RATHER THAN ITS OWN
 * SENTENCE: a client that hard-coded which stage is missing would go on saying
 * it after somebody built the thing that fills it. "Shortlisted" is not in the
 * list at all and is not drawn — a stage nobody will ever count is not a gap,
 * it is a feature nobody asked for.
 *
 * THE KPI TILES ARE THE SERVER'S FIGURES, INCLUDING ITS NULLS. `placement_rate_
 * pct` is null — never 0.0 — when nobody is eligible, and the tile prints a
 * dash for it, because "0% placed" and "there is nobody to place" are opposite
 * facts. The CTC pair is taken over APPROVED offers that carry a CTC, and
 * `ctc_offers_counted` travels with it so the tile can say over how many; a
 * median printed without that number invites the reader to assume it is over
 * all of them.
 *
 * THE STATUS DONUT IS ARITHMETIC, NOT AN ESTIMATE. `offers` is every submitted
 * offer, `approved` is the approved ones and `GET /api/mentor/offers/pending`
 * is the authoritative pending list, so "not approved" is the remainder — three
 * real numbers, no sampling of the twenty-five rows on screen. When that
 * pending list does not answer (it is `require_admin`, so a MENTOR granted
 * `admin.placement` is refused it) the remainder is no longer a fact, and the
 * donut is WITHHELD rather than drawn off a floor.
 *
 * THE DECISION IS THE SELECTION. The board puts Reject and Approve offer in the
 * grid's toolbar over a checkbox column, so the selection is what gets decided;
 * only a PENDING offer is selectable, which is what makes "approve the
 * selection" unambiguous. Rejecting still needs a reason — the student is shown
 * it against their offer and nothing else — and the offers are posted one at a
 * time to `/mentor/offers/{id}/decision`, stopping at the first refusal with
 * the server's own sentence on screen rather than half a decision nobody can
 * see.
 *
 * The decision endpoint is `/mentor/offers/{id}/decision`, gated by
 * `require_admin` — the path says mentor, the guard says Main Admin, and the
 * guard is what governs. Kept there so there is one implementation of "approve
 * an offer".
 *
 * TWO OF THE BOARD'S THREE FILTERS ARE PARAMETERS ON THE ONE ENDPOINT, AND THE
 * THIRD IS NOT A FILTER AT ALL. `?cohort_id=` and `?year=` narrow the whole
 * payload server-side — every count, the split and the recent list move
 * together, which is what keeps the funnel's columns adding up — so both are
 * re-read rather than filtered here. `?track=` DOES NOT EXIST: the payload
 * answers the track question as a SPLIT (`by_track`, placed over eligible per
 * specialization) and narrowing to one track client-side would leave the funnel
 * and the KPIs describing the whole reach beside a caption naming one track.
 * That select is therefore disabled with the real reason on it and no phase
 * number — nothing is coming to make it a parameter.
 *
 * THE BATCH LIST IS A SECOND FUNCTION. `GET /api/admin/cohorts` checks
 * `admin.analytics`, not this screen's `admin.placement`, so a granted faculty
 * member can be refused it — the select then says so rather than standing
 * empty, and the payload is still the whole reach.
