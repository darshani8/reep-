"""A rejected applicant may apply again; a live application still may not be doubled.

THE INCIDENT, as reported: "rejected people not able to reapply the student
registration". `registrations.email` was UNIQUE outright and the guard in
`submit` read every row, so an address the office had rejected - for a
mistyped USN, say - met the duplicate 409 on its corrected second attempt,
with the same opaque words a live duplicate gets, and the rejection mail had
told them to contact the same office. Migration d7e2f9a41c86 made the unique
PARTIAL (`status <> 'REJECTED'`) and the guard reads the same rule.

What these pin:

  * A rejected address applies again and gets a 201; the rejected row STAYS,
    as the record of the decision, and the new row is a new application.
  * The reviewer is told: the new row's checklist carries `prior_applications`
    as a WARN naming the reason given last time. Never a block.
  * A LIVE application on the address still refuses a second one (409), and
    the DATABASE refuses it too, so two submissions racing the guard cannot
    both land - proven against the real schema, inside a rolled-back
    transaction.
  * The rejection mail now says applying again is possible.
