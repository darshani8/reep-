/**
 * Add faculty member — the four-step wizard.
 *
 * The approved board is `docs/redesign-2026-09/design/admin/AddFaculty.html`,
 * specified in `02-admin-console-spec.md` §8. One endpoint on `main` creates a
 * faculty login — `POST /api/admin/faculty` (`app/routers/admin_faculty.py`,
 * `require_admin`) — and this screen is built on that one and on the two reads
 * the cascade needs: `GET /api/admin/colleges` and
 * `GET /api/admin/colleges/{id}/departments`. Nothing else is called.
 *
 * WHY A WIZARD AND NOT ONE FORM. The account IS the access control (AGENTS.md,
 * "the roster IS the access control"), and the board splits the decision into
 * the four questions the office actually asks in order: where this person
 * teaches, who they are, what they may do, and how they are invited. The
 * institution question is first because a faculty login filed under nothing is
 * invisible to every question that starts "who teaches in…".
 *
 * WHAT PHASE 3 LANDED AND WHAT IS STILL GREY. None of it is invented and no
 * control that would 404 is live:
 *
 *   - **Department is required, on the server now** (`B3.1`).
 *     `AdminFacultyIn.department_id` is a plain `str` and its validator answers
 *     422 on a blank one, saying why. That sentence is rendered VERBATIM
 *     (`DEPARTMENT_REQUIRED_MESSAGE`) rather than paraphrased: it names the
 *     consequence — the department is how this account reaches its COLLEGE, and
 *     the college is what decides which addresses may hold one — and a screen
 *     that restates a server rule in its own words is a second copy of that
 *     rule to keep true.
 *   - **The college email domain fence** (`B3.2`, over the `email_domains`
 *     `B1.1` put on the college). `_email_policy` in
 *     `app/routers/admin_faculty.py` refuses an address off the college's
 *     domains unless `allow_external` is set AND `external_reason` is written,
 *     and it writes the pair, the domain and the list into the audit row. Both
 *     fields are live on step 2: the checkbox reveals the reason, and the
 *     reason is required while it is ticked. The college's own domains come
 *     back on `GET /api/admin/colleges` (`email_domains`) and are shown, so the
 *     fence is visible before it refuses anybody — but the comparison drawn on
 *     screen is a HINT and says so, because a college that has recorded no
 *     domains falls back to the deployment's own list
 *     (`app/institution_domains.py`), which this screen cannot see. The server
 *     is the only fence; this one only saves a round trip.
 *   - **Employee ID** and **functions at creation** are disabled and carry no
 *     phase number: Phase 4 has landed and reached neither, and neither is
 *     coming — there is no employee id anywhere in the API, and a function is
 *     granted with a reason, a scope and an expiry that this wizard does not
 *     ask for. See `EMPLOYEE_ID_REASON` and `FUNCTIONS_AT_CREATION_REASON`.
 *   - **Mail.** `GET /api/admin/platform/status` (`B3.7`) still does not exist
 *     — nothing under `/api/admin` answers it — so this screen never predicts
 *     whether the invitation can be emailed. The create response's own
 *     `emailed` flag is the answer, after the fact, and the activation link is
 *     shown exactly when it is `false` — the board's "a link is shown only if
 *     email is unavailable, once", and B3.7's own instruction that this wizard
 *     "must not promise an email that cannot be sent".
 *
 * THE LINK IS SHOWN ONCE, AND THE SERVER IS THE ONE SAYING SO.
 * `AdminFacultyOut.shown_once` is `true` (`B3.4`): nothing stores the raw
 * token, only its sha256, so this response is the only place the link exists.
 * The screen honours that — the link is held in no signal past "Add another",
 * is never listed, and the copy control is offered beside it while it is on
 * screen. Re-minting one is the Faculty screen's "Activation link" action,
 * which is a deliberate act with its own endpoint. Which of the two things
 * happened is stated either way: emailed to the address, or not sent at all
 * and therefore only here — which is what a deployment whose SES is still
 * sandboxed gets, every time.
 *
 * ONE PRIMARY BUTTON. The footer's Continue is the view's primary through
 * steps 1–3, becomes "Create account & invite" on step 4, and becomes "Done"
 * once the account exists. Every other control here is secondary or ghost.
