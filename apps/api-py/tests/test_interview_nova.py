"""The Nova 2 Sonic engine: the arc, the record, and what goes on the wire.

app/interview_nova.py runs the same interview as the relay on Amazon Nova 2
Sonic. The model owns the TURN there (Nova detects the end of the student's
speech and answers on its own; there is no `response.create` to withhold), so
what this engine owns is the PHASE — and that is precisely what these tests
pin, because it is the half a reader cannot check by listening to a call.

NO DATABASE, NO SOCKET AND NO AWS: a fake browser socket that records what was
forwarded, a fake upstream that records the event documents that would have
gone to Bedrock, and `on_turn=None` so the persistence path is never entered.
What is asserted is what went ON THE WIRE and what the state machine did.

Each test is named for the failure it prevents, because that is the only useful
thing to know when one of them goes red in two years.
