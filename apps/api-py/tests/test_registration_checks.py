"""B11.1 — the review queue's `checks[]`, and the guards they speak for.

THE CONTRACT THIS MODULE PINS, in one sentence: a check whose status is
"blocked" is a guard in `_provision_student` that will refuse this exact
application, and there is no guard without a check in front of it. That is the
only property that makes the panel worth drawing — a reviewer who is shown a
clean checklist and then met with a 422 learns not to read the checklist, and a
reviewer shown a blocker that Approve would have sailed through learns to
reject applications the queue handles correctly.

So every "blocked" assertion below is paired with the status code the decision
endpoint actually answers, in the same test, on the same row. Split them and
the pair can drift without either half going red.
