/**
 * Interview records — every mock interview in scope, with the student named,
 * the record panel beside it and the recordings behind the same gate as ever.
 *
 * The approved board is `docs/redesign-2026-09/design/admin/InterviewRecords.html`
 * and the brief is `02-admin-console-spec.md` §17. Five decisions in this build
 * are worth reading before changing it.
 *
 * SCOPE IS THE SERVER'S. `GET /api/admin/interviews` applies BOTH fences in SQL
 * — rule 2 narrows a mentor to their own group and runs always, and the B1.2
 * reach narrows a grant somebody chose to hand over — and a caller who is both
 * gets the intersection. This screen renders whatever it is handed and never
 * widens it. The route is guarded on the same `admin.interviews` capability the
 * endpoint checks, so a grant that reports success in Governance opens the door
 * it names.
 *
 * THE FILTERS ARE THE SERVER'S TOO, AND THAT IS WHY THEY MOVED. Batch, track,
 * status, date and recorded-only are query parameters on `/api/admin/interviews`
 * and on its KPI and CSV siblings, so all three answer over the same rows: a
 * tile can never report a number the grid below it cannot produce, and the
 * extract is the list the operator was looking at. Filtering in the browser
 * could never have answered Batch at all — a record row carries no cohort.
 *
 * A SCORE IS IN THE PAYLOAD NOW, AND A NULL IS STILL A DASH. `overall_score` is
 * on every grid row (B6.7), so the Score column and the average tile are read
 * rather than reconstructed. NULLABLE, AND A NULL RENDERS AS A DASH:
 * `interview_evaluations.overall_score` is nullable even when the report
 * parsed, so a confident 0 in a 24px numeral would tell the office a student
 * failed something nobody scored. The same rule governs the average tile — an
 * average over no scored interview is `null`, never 0.
 *
 * PAGING IS A CURSOR, NOT A PAGE NUMBER. Interviews are written continuously,
 * so an offset taken against a list that grows at the top silently skips rows.
 * The server hands back `next_cursor`; "Load more" appends the next page, and
 * the grid paginates what has been loaded. There is deliberately no total
 * count anywhere — counting every interview to render "page 3 of 47" costs a
 * full scan on every keystroke — and the KPI tiles answer the question that
 * number stands in for, once and properly.
 *
 * "RECORDED" IS READ FROM `audio_recorded`, NEVER FROM A PATH. The flag is the
 * fact; a NULL `audio_path` collapses "capture disabled", "consent refused",
 * "the write failed" and "predates capture" into one silence (app/models/
 * interview.py). Nothing in this file reads a path, and the server does not
 * expose one.
 *
 * CONSENT IS SHOWN AS AN ENFORCED FACT, NOT A SWITCH. Nothing on this screen
 * can grant, edit or withdraw a scope. Since B6.1 what is consented to is the
 * COLLEGE'S decision and the student's row is an acknowledgement of it, so the
 * thing this office edits is the POLICY — and it edits it on the policy card
 * at the foot of the screen, never on a student's row. `DELETE
 * /api/interview/consent` does not exist and answers 405 for everyone.
 *
 * THE POLICY CARD MUST BE ABLE TO SAY "NOT CONFIGURED". No `interview_policies`
 * row is ever seeded, and the ABSENCE of one IS the default — a deployment that
 * never touches the card behaves exactly as it did before the table existed. So
 * `default: null` is rendered as "Not configured", with the numbers actually in
 * force in the boxes as the deployment's defaults. Drawing that state as a row
 * holding the defaults would report a decision nobody made.
 *
 * ONE COLUMN, TOP TO BOTTOM (2026-09-15). The side column — a record panel, a
 * progress card and a retention card with the policy behind a toggle — is
 * gone. The open record is a card under the list, with its report or
 * transcript on the left and the student's score-over-time chart on the
 * right; the policy is its own card, always open, with the college picker on
 * it. Every control the board had is here; what left is the prose — the
 * consent note, the chart note, the retention list and the two policy
 * paragraphs — the Transcript/Report buttons on the grid bar that duplicated
 * the record's own tabs, and the Batch filter for a session whose grant cannot
 * read the batch list, which was a grey control with the reason in a tooltip.
 *
 * DOWNLOAD, NOT DELETE. Per the owner's decision a recording can be downloaded
 * to the local machine and there is no delete here — recordings expire on the
 * deployment's retention clock, which is the only thing that removes them. One row
 * downloads the mixed track as an attachment; the selection posts its ids and
 * streams back one zip. Both go through `admin.interview_audio`, which the
 * Main Admin holds by baseline and a mentor only by an explicit grant.
