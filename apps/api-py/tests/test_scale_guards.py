"""The 2026-08 scalability-fix guards, pinned.

Three guards landed together and each is the kind that gets deleted the first
time it inconveniences someone, so each is pinned the way the boot guard is:

* the per-user LLM rate limit (app/ratelimit.py) — 429 with Retry-After, unit
  and end-to-end through POST /api/agent/chat;
* the per-student DAILY interview cap (_open_records raising _DailyCapReached
  -> close 4015) — the volume half of the per-user cap, refused before any row
  is written or any upstream socket billed;
* GET /api/student/overview — the one-request composition of the landing
  page's ten reads, whose keys the Angular component destructures by name.

The autouse conftest fixture resets the limiter and the leaderboard cache
before every test, so these tests build their own warm state and assert on it.

    so the two have to be finished before the third is refused. The property the
