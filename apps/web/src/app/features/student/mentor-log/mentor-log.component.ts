/**
 * Mentor / TPO Log — the student's own 1:1 history, and the SWOC written about
 * them.
 *
 * Named for both because both write here: the assigned mentor and the placement
 * cell. It is VIEW-ONLY apart from requesting a meeting — nothing on this screen
 * approves, verifies or signs anything, and no admin content appears on it.
 *
 * Reads `mentor_notes` filtered to the signed-in student. The screen says
 * plainly that these notes are visible to the student and the placement office,
 * which is why nothing is filtered by author or hidden here: a note a student
 * cannot see is a note that should not have been written on that table.
 *
 * The mentor's internal vocabulary is translated server-side — FLAGGED reads as
 * "Flagged for follow-up" — so this component renders `action_label` and never
 * the raw enum.

/**
 * One SWOC line, as /student/overview returns it — B7.5.
 *
 * IT USED TO BE `{ text }` AND THE FOUR BOXES JOINED THE TEXTS WITH A DOT.
 * That was a fair rendering of a payload that carried nothing else, and it is
 * why the quadrant now lists its lines instead: `author`, `recorded_at` and
 * `acknowledged_at` are per ENTRY, and a concatenated string has nowhere to put
 * them. Nothing about the four tiles, their colours or their order changes — the
 * board is the same board, each line simply keeps its own footer now.
 *
 * `author: null` MEANS NOBODY WAS RECORDED, and that is the only thing it can
 * mean: `swoc_entries.author_user_id` is ON DELETE SET NULL, so an account going
 * away clears the pointer rather than leaving a name to fail to resolve. "Author
 * not recorded" is therefore the honest wording; the admin board's old "Author
 * no longer on the roster" said somebody left, about rows nobody ever wrote.
