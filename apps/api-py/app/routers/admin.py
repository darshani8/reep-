"""Main Admin — the institutional write layer.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS. Before it, nothing in the running application could
create a College, a Department or a Cohort, seat a student in one, or write
`users.department` / `users.designation`. All of it was CLI-and-seed only, and
`app/seed.py` refuses to run when ENV=prod — so on a production host no cohort
could exist at all, and four of the five fields on the student's locked profile
card could not be filled by any means short of direct SQL.

THE HIERARCHY IT MAINTAINS:

    College -> Department -> Cohort -> Student.cohort_id

"Batch" on screen is `Cohort` here. The mapping is deliberate and is explained
once in docs/institutional-spine-build-log.md.

ARCHIVE, NEVER DELETE. There is no DELETE endpoint in this file. Status moves
ACTIVE <-> ARCHIVED, which is what the design's console does and what the
foreign keys enforce anyway: the database refuses to delete a college that still
has departments, or a cohort that still has students. A graduated student's
record must still name the college they attended.

SCHEMA NAMING. Cohort responses here are `AdminCohortOut`, not `CohortOut`.
Two different `CohortOut` classes already exist with different shapes
(`console.py:116` and `badge_verification.py:429`) — the same collision this
codebase already has for `LeaderboardOut`, where the payload depends on which
URL you happened to hit. A third would make it worse, so this one is named for
its surface.

CAPABILITY. `admin.institution` (the Main Admin by baseline, a faculty member
only when granted in Governance), matching every other admin surface
including `voice_platform/api/admin.py`. A narrower Main-Admin-only gate belongs
with the capability work, not here — inventing a second gate now would mean two
answers to "who may administer", which is exactly the shape of bug rule 2 exists
to prevent.

    `model_dump(exclude_unset=True)` to tell omitted from sent. But
    `exclude_unset` is not `exclude_none`: `{"name": null}` is SENT, so it

# ------------------------------------------------------- college admins (B1.3) --
#
# THERE IS NO SECOND MAIN ADMIN, AND THIS IS NOT ONE.
#
# REEP has exactly one office account by rule, and `app.grant_access`'s
# `_refuse_second_main_admin` is what keeps it that way. Nothing in this section
# touches it, changes anybody's `users.role`, or mints an account: a "college
# admin" here is a FACULTY account (role MENTOR, unchanged) holding a set of
# `admin.*` capability grants SCOPED to one college. That is the whole idea —
# the function is the grant, the role is the identity, and the second college a
# deployment onboards gets somebody who runs it without getting the keys to the
# first one.
#
# WHY AN ENDPOINT RATHER THAN "USE GOVERNANCE ELEVEN TIMES". Appointing one is
# eleven grants, all with the same scope and the same reason, and eleven
# separate acts on the Governance screen is eleven chances to hold the set
# wrong: ten of eleven is a person whose console half works, and a twelfth key
# added by mistake is `admin.governance` — the one that hands access on. One
# call, one reason, one audit trail, a fixed list in code.
#
# WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT IN THE SET is as much of the decision as what is:
# `admin.governance` (a college admin must not be able to appoint anybody,
# including themselves, to anything — Governance stays the Main Admin's and its
# deputy's), `admin.interview_audio` (a recording is a named student's voice and
# is its own decision every time, which is why it is the one key the Main Admin
# holds and grants separately) and every `mentor.*` key (a college admin is not
# a faculty member of that college's students — the same reasoning
# `_FACULTY_ONLY` applies to the Main Admin). `ui.console_v2` was a fourth, kept
# out as "a rendering preview, not a function"; Phase 5 deleted the key itself.
#
# `admin.interviews` IS NOW IN THE CATALOGUE and is in the set below (Phase 4c,
# B6.1/B6.4). It was listed in 04-backend-changes.md for this set for months
# while the key did not exist, and this comment used to say so — the note is
# kept in the past tense because the rule it records is the one that matters:
# a name in this tuple with no catalogue entry is a KeyError in
# `CAPABILITIES_BY_KEY[key]` below, thrown in front of whoever is appointing a
# college admin. The key, its first `require_capability` call site
# (`app/routers/interview_policy.py`) and this line landed in ONE commit, the
# same rule `admin.imports` was held to. It carries PII, so it is one of the
# keys that lands `pending_approval`. `admin.interview_questions` is the other
# interview key and stays: the two are different decisions — who may edit the
# questions the interviewer asks, and who may set the college's policy and read
# the records. The appointment endpoint is idempotent, so re-running it on an
# existing college admin fills in whatever is missing.
#
# `admin.imports` (B8.1) IS in the set, by the owner's decision, and it carries
# PII — so it is one of the seven of thirteen that land `pending_approval` and hold
# nothing until a second `admin.governance` holder approves them. That is the
# state `CollegeAdminGrantOut.approval_state` reports per key, for exactly this
# reason.

#: The functions that make up "runs this college". Ordered as the console's
#: sidebar orders them, so the screen and this list can be read against each
