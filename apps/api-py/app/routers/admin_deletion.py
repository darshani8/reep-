    POST  /api/admin/users/{id}/restore                        back, nothing lost

    GET   /api/admin/colleges/{id}/delete-plan
    POST  /api/admin/colleges/{id}/delete    {code, reason}   the structure, gone

MAIN ADMIN ONLY, every one of them (`require_admin`), and not a capability:
the owner's rule is that deleting a person or a college is the office's act,
and a capability is a thing the office hands to somebody else. `AGENTS.md`
records why there was NO delete here until now; this module is the owner
asking for one, built the way the purge modules are built rather than the way
the 2026-09-10 delete was.

TWO ANSWERS, AND THEY ARE NOT DEGREES OF ONE THING. REMOVE writes
`users.deleted_at` (`app/models/user.py` says why it is a column beside
`disabled_at`): the person leaves every roster and picker, cannot sign in by
any door (`User.barred_at`), every row they own stays, and RESTORE undoes it
with nothing lost. It asks for a REASON in words, disabling's rule. DELETE is
`app/account_deletion.py`: the rows, the files, the recordings, gone, and it
asks for the CODE.

THE CODE IS THE SECOND FACTOR, AND IT IS MAILED TO THE OFFICE ACCOUNT'S OWN
ADDRESS, never one from the request. Being signed in is not enough for an
act nobody can undo: the cookie is on whichever machine the office left open,
the mailbox is not. Six digits, `settings.otp_code_minutes` to live, spent by
ONE act — `consume_user_code`'s atomic UPDATE is the arbiter, so two deletes
racing on one code get one delete. A wrong code is a 403 that names nothing
about the target and spends nothing; the code is spent BEFORE anything is
destroyed and never after. Requests for a code are throttled per admin, so
the button cannot be turned into a mail cannon against the office's inbox.

THE PLAN ENDPOINTS ARE WHAT THE DIALOG SHOWS BEFORE THE BUTTON. They count,
they destroy nothing, and they are the same walk the delete runs — so what
the office reads is what happens. A college plan also carries the BLOCKERS
(people seated or filed under it, open applications), and the delete refuses
while any remain, inside its own transaction, whatever the dialog said a
minute earlier.
