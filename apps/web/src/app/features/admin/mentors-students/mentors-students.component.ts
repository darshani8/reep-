/**
 * Mentor mapping — the board at docs/redesign-2026-09/design/admin/MentorMapping.html
 * (02-admin-console-spec.md §9), on `/admin/mentors`.
 *
 * MENTOR-FIRST, deliberately. Pick a faculty member on the left rail; the
 * unassigned students sit on the right; tick the ones to seat and press the
 * view's one primary action. An earlier shape offered "assign a mentor to
 * students" and "assign students to a mentor" behind a toggle, which is the
 * same operation described twice.
 *
 * "N FREE" IS POLICY, NOT A ROW, AND IT IS STILL ADVISORY. The Mentor row has
 * no capacity; the figure is returned on every faculty member as `capacity`,
 * and nothing refuses an assignment past it — an admin who chooses to overload
 * one faculty member in a thin year should not have to edit .env first. The
 * rail says "At capacity" in the risk colour and lets them. No control on this
 * screen may imply otherwise.
 *
 * B9.2 changed only WHERE THE NUMBER COMES FROM, which is what that sentence
 * was really complaining about: `departments.mentor_capacity` now answers it
 * when the department has named one, falling back to the programme's
 * `settings.mentor_capacity` otherwise, so tuning it for one department is a
 * row and not a deploy. `capacity_source` says which, and the rail prints the
 * two differently: "25, set by Management Studies" and "25, the programme
 * default" are different sentences even when the figure matches.
 *
 * mentor_id IS THE SCOPE KEY. It is what rule 2 filters staff access on, so
 * every write here is Main-Admin-only server-side and a mentor cannot reach
 * it — a mentor able to set it could assign themselves any student in the
 * programme and then read everything about them.
 *
 * Both lists are re-fetched after a change rather than patched locally: a
 * roster and a pool that disagree about where a student is are worse than a
 * moment's wait.
 *
 * WHAT THE SERVER ANSWERS AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. `GET /admin/mentor-load` and
 * `GET /admin/unassigned-students` both take `?department_id=` and
 * `?cohort_id=` (B9.4/B1.5), so the board's first two filters are real. Neither
 * takes a specialization, so the board's third one is disabled with that as its
 * reason and no phase number on it — the treatment `45b91a9` gave the Faculty
 * screen's orphan controls. The board's per-FACULTY assignment history is the
 * same case: `GET /admin/students/{id}/mentor-history` answers for ONE STUDENT,
 * which is a different query, so the history card is wired per mentee and the
 * toolbar button says so rather than promising a feed nobody wrote.
 *
 * FACULTY ACCOUNTS MOVED. Creating a faculty login, re-minting an activation
 * link and filing somebody under a department were on this screen; they are
 * §7 Faculty (`/admin/faculty`) and §8 Add faculty (`/admin/faculty/new`) in
 * the redesign. This screen is the seating chart and nothing else.
