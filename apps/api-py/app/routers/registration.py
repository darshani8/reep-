"""Programme sign-up flow (ported from the Next.js registration path).

Public submission runs the data-driven rule engine: among enabled rules, every
*populated* condition (email domain, USN regex, degree level) must match, and the
lowest `priority` among the matches decides. A matching auto-approve rule waves
the application through (AUTO_APPROVED) and assigns its cohort; a matching
non-auto rule routes it to a human (PENDING_REVIEW) with a label; no match falls
to manual review. The Main Admin then approves/rejects the queue.

APPROVAL PROVISIONS. It was once true that it did not — this docstring said so
for the whole life of the file, three lines from the top, and it was the
original of the false claim B11.4 exists to strike. `decide` (APPROVE) mints the
User row, the Student row seated in the rule's cohort and a profile row, moves
the CV and photo onto that student's own uploads and emails the onboarding link,
all in one transaction; `_apply_rule` does the same for an auto-approved
application. Nothing exists before that decision.

WHAT APPROVAL DOES NOT DO IS LET ANYONE IN. The account carries the unusable
`SSO_ONLY_PASSWORD_HASH` sentinel, and the applicant must still open the emailed
link, type their address back, read a six-digit code, spend it for a ticket and
set a password before they can sign in (`app/routers/onboarding.py`, three
steps). "Approved" and "active" are two different facts and any copy that says
otherwise — here, or on the applicant's own result card — is wrong.

# --- usn_pattern is DB-sourced regex run on an UNAUTHENTICATED endpoint -------
#
# `RegistrationRule.usn_pattern` is a regular expression that arrives from the
# database and is executed on POST /register, which has no cookie and no roster
# check in front of it. Two ways that ends badly, and in both the *rule* is the
# thing that is broken while the *front door* is the thing that falls over:
#
#   * an invalid pattern (a bare "[") raises re.error inside the engine, so every
#     USN-carrying application 500s and nothing in the response — or, before
#     this, in the log — names the rule that did it;
#   * a catastrophic pattern ("(a+)+$") backtracks exponentially: a ReDoS an
#     anonymous caller can fire at will, one HTTP request at a time.
#
# Planting either needs an admin/DB write, so this is a blast-radius problem
# rather than an entry point. It is defended twice anyway, because a rule row can
# always be edited straight in psql and skip whatever the write path checks:
#
#   1. validate_usn_pattern() at rule-WRITE time. app/seed.py is the only writer
#      today (the RegistrationRule(...) block); any future admin-facing rule
#      editor MUST call it before commit and hand the ValueError back to the
#      author, who is the only person able to fix the pattern.
#   2. _usn_matcher() at MATCH time, which refuses to run a pattern that fails
#      the same check and drops that one rule instead of the request.

# A USN format is a short fixed shape ("^1BG2[0-9]MBA[0-9]{3}$"). Nothing
# legitimate needs more than this, and the cap is what stops a pathological
# pattern being pasted in at all.
MAX_USN_PATTERN_LENGTH = 200

# Backtracking cost is a function of the SUBJECT length, so the engine is never
# handed a long one. RegisterIn already caps `usn` at 32, but _rule_matches is a

# caller for the bound that keeps it cheap.
MAX_USN_MATCH_LENGTH = 64

# behind essentially every real-world ReDoS, including the overlapping-alternation
# form "(a|aa)+" that a nested-quantifier check alone would miss. Deciding whether
# an arbitrary regex backtracks catastrophically is not something to attempt in a
# router, and a USN pattern has no honest use for a quantified group, so the whole

# duplicate-email branch in submit() — a free "has this person applied here"
# lookup for anyone holding a list of names.
#
# Fixed window, keyed on the socket peer, held in this process. Three caveats
# stated plainly so nobody reads more into it than it gives:
#
#   * PER WORKER. N uvicorn workers give N times this limit, and a restart
#     forgets every window. It raises the cost of a flood; it is not a quota, and
#     a real one needs shared state (Postgres or Redis) this endpoint does not
#     have.
#   * The key is request.client.host, the SOCKET peer. Behind a reverse proxy
#     that is the proxy, so an entire campus can share one bucket — which is why
#     the limit is deliberately generous rather than tight: a class of sixty
#     applying from one NAT on results day must not lock itself out. If you put a
#     trusted proxy in front, read the real client from ITS header and say so
#     here. X-Forwarded-For is not trusted as it stands, because a header the
#     caller sets is a limiter the caller can switch off.
#   * The table is bounded, so the limiter cannot itself become the memory
#     exhaustion it exists to prevent. An attacker with thousands of live source
#     addresses can flush it — but they can also just spend the limit from each
#     of those addresses, so the table size was never the control.

    private than the `requested_cohort_id` they typed on the form.

    Today none of them could travel anyway — the upload endpoint refuses an
    application that has been decided, and `reopen` clears the reviewer's stamp
    on the way back into the queue. That is exactly why this is a SHAPE and not
    a filter: both of those are one small edit away from being untrue, and the
    edit that breaks them will not look like it touches a public response. A
    schema that never carried the field cannot start carrying it by accident.

    `decision_reason` IS here, and deliberately: it is the rule engine's verdict
    written FOR the applicant, and the result card is the only place it is ever
    shown ("Domain matched — auto-approved", "Held for review").

    """The review queue — applications a human still needs to decide.

    WITH NO `?status=` THIS ANSWERS EXACTLY WHAT IT ALWAYS HAS: every
    PENDING_REVIEW application in reach, oldest first, unbounded, with the same
    scope headers. That is load-bearing rather than politeness — the Phase 2
    console is built against this array and the Pending tab is the screen's
    default view, so a page size appearing here would silently truncate the one
    list the office actually works from.

    `?status=` IS THE OTHER THREE TABS (B11.2, decision 2). One of
    `LISTABLE_STATUSES`; anything else is a 422 that names them. The bound comes
    with it and is not optional: see DEFAULT_QUEUE_LIMIT.

    WHY THE ORDER DEPENDS ON THE STATUS. A queue and a log are read from
    opposite ends. PENDING_REVIEW and HOLD are work waiting, and the row that
    matters is the applicant who has waited longest, so they come oldest first —
    the order this endpoint has always used. AUTO_APPROVED, APPROVED and
    REJECTED are a record of what happened, where the row that matters is the
    most recent one, and paging an unbounded history from the far end would put
    a deployment's first-ever application on page one forever.

    SCOPED BY THE CLAIM (B1.4), through `registration_scope_clause`. An
    application is not a student yet, so there is no `students` row for
    `Reach.student_ids()` to narrow: what it hangs under is what the applicant
    NAMED on the public form, walked up the spine by `_resolve_claim` and stored
    on the row. See app/scope_views.py for why that projection lives there.

    AN APPLICATION THAT NAMED NOTHING IS THE MAIN ADMIN'S. Every level on the
    form is optional, so a row with all five pointers null hangs under nothing
    and is reached by no scoped grant — the same answer `reaches_target` gives
    any unfiled thing, and the same reason: if "named nothing" were visible to
    everybody, it would be the way around every scope in the system, and it is
    a state a public form can produce on purpose.

    EVERY ROW CARRIES ITS CHECKS (B11.1) — the rule engine's verdict, the college
    domain fence, whose account this address already is, and the USN. Three of
    them are the guards `_provision_student` will apply when Approve is pressed,
    read out BEFORE the press rather than after: see `_checks_for` for the
    batching and the check vocabulary above `CheckOut` for what the three
    verdicts mean.

    provisioning "a separate follow-up step", and that step was nowhere in the
    codebase. `registrations.approved_student_id` was declared, returned by the
    API, and never written. The only ways a Student came into existence were
    `python -m app.seed_roster`, `python -m app.grant_access` and the dev-only
    `python -m app.seed` — all shell-only, none of which read this table.

    IDEMPOTENT BY LOOKUP, not by flag. A double-clicked Approve must not create
    two students. The email is unique on `users`, so an existing row is found
    and reused rather than inserted again; and if the registration already
    carries an approved_student_id, that student is returned untouched. Relying
    on the caller not to double-click is not a design.

    Reached twice, this function inserts nothing twice — and that is tested
    DIRECTLY (test_institutional_spine.py calls it twice in one session),
    because through the endpoint the already-decided 409 fires first and every
    lookup below could be deleted with the endpoint test still passing.

    TWO THINGS IT REFUSES, both because the application it is reading arrived
    from an unauthenticated public form: an address off the college domain, and
    an address that already belongs to a non-STUDENT account. See the guards
    inline — each one is a door into the roster that this function would
    otherwise open.

    NO PASSWORD IS SET. The account gets the unusable sentinel. Sign-in is
    Google-only in production, and where a password is wanted it arrives through
    activation — an invitation the student redeems — not from an admin reading
    one out.

    THE COHORT COMES FROM THE RULE. `registrations.cohort_id` was stamped by the
    matched registration rule at submit time. Copying it onto the student here
    is what finally connects the rule engine to a seat; before this it was
    written to the registrations row and read by nothing.

    decision is made on evidence - but the evidence itself had no route out of

    application whose one attachment they could not open, which is
    `mentor.download_student_upload`'s bug ("the queue was asking people to
    verify evidence they could not open") sitting on the other queue, unnoticed
    because this one never had a download to begin with.

    GATED EXACTLY LIKE THE DECISION IT FEEDS: `admin.registrations`, then
    `_assert_reachable`. That pairing is the point - a reviewer who cannot see
    an application in the queue must not be able to read its files by id, and
    writing the gate as the queue's own predicate re-selected is what makes the
    two the same rule rather than two readings of it.

    SO AN UNREACHABLE APPLICATION IS 403 HERE, NOT 404, and that is deliberate

    one endpoint's refusal out of step with every other verb on the same row.
    404 is kept for the three facts that really are absences: no such
    application, no such kind, no document of that kind attached.

    ATTACHMENT, NEVER INLINE. `content_disposition`'s default, for the reason it
    states: everything in this store is a file a stranger uploaded - here
    literally an unauthenticated stranger - and a PDF rendered inline runs its
    embedded JavaScript in the SPA's own origin. The magic-byte sniff cannot
    help, because the payload IS a valid PDF.

    A FILE MISSING FROM THE VOLUME IS A 404. `read_bytes` raises

    "open this document" when the bytes are gone is that there is nothing to
    open - not a 500 that reads to the office as a broken console. The row

    WHY THE STATUS EXISTS. Without it the queue carries two kinds of
    PENDING_REVIEW that look identical and mean opposite things: "nobody has
    looked at this" and "I looked, and it is waiting on a CV the applicant has
    not sent". The second was recorded by doing nothing, so the next reviewer
    read the application from scratch and the applicant waited twice.

    A NOTE IS REQUIRED - 422 without one. A HOLD carrying no words is
    indistinguishable from PENDING_REVIEW on every screen in the product, so the
    note is not decoration on the feature, it IS the feature. This is the same
    rule as B3.1's disable reason and for the same reason: nobody remembers in
    six weeks, and the row is the only place that could have said.

    IT IS INTERNAL, and that is a decision rather than an omission. Nothing is
    mailed, `decision_reason` is untouched, and the note does not travel to the
    applicant - `PublicRegistrationOut` declares none of the three hold columns
    and `_public_out_one` narrows by `model_fields`. Communicating a hold would
    need a mail that a sandboxed SES account cannot send, which is the exact
    failure that killed PENDING_VERIFICATION; a gate nobody can pass is an
    outage, and a notice nobody receives is worse than none.

    ONLY A PENDING APPLICATION CAN BE HELD. Re-holding one that is already on
    hold is a 409 naming reopen rather than an in-place edit of the note: two
    audit rows (released, held again) say what happened, where a silent
    overwrite loses the first reviewer's words entirely.

    Reached through `_assert_reachable`, the same predicate the queue is listed
    by, so a scoped reviewer cannot hold an application they cannot see.

# --- B11.3 · the seating rules themselves -------------------------------------
#
# A RULE WITH `auto_approve` AND A BATCH IS THE ONE CONTROL IN THIS PRODUCT THAT
# SEATS A STUDENT WITHOUT A HUMAN. `_apply_rule` stamps the batch and calls
# `_provision_student`, which mints the User row, the Student row and the
# profile, moves the documents across and emails the onboarding link — and the
# application never appears in anybody's queue. Every decision below is shaped by
# that one fact rather than by CRUD convention:
#
#   * `validate_usn_pattern` IS CALLED ON EVERY WRITE, and its ValueError comes
#     back as a 422 carrying that message verbatim. The message was written for
#     the rule AUTHOR, who is the only person who can fix the pattern. Not
#     calling it would let an admin store "(a+)+$" and turn POST /register — the
#     one unauthenticated write in the app — into a ReDoS anybody can fire. This
#     is rule-write defence #1 from the comment block at the top of this module;
#     `_usn_matcher`'s match-time refusal is #2 and stays exactly where it is,
#     because a rule row can always be edited straight in psql and skip whatever
#     this path checks.
#   * NOTHING TOUCHES `_usn_matcher`'s CACHE. It is keyed on the pattern STRING,
#     so an edited pattern is a new key and the fix takes effect with no restart;
#     a deleted rule leaves its compiled matcher behind, and nothing ever looks
#     it up again — one entry in a 256-entry LRU. Keying that cache on the rule
#     id instead, which is the obvious "fix", would make an edit invisible until
#     a restart: the opposite of what the cache is for.
#   * THERE IS NO REORDER CONTROL, and there must not be one. `_pick_rule` breaks
#     a `priority` tie on `created_at` "so a rule added later can't silently
#     outrank an equal", and a screen where an author types a priority produces
#     ties constantly. A drag-to-reorder that rewrote `created_at` would rewrite
#     which rule fired yesterday, under a control that looks cosmetic. Priority
#     is typed; equal priorities are settled by age; age is not editable.
#   * EVERY WRITE IS AUDITED, the delete included, with the rule's whole
#     before-state on the row. The evidence of a bad rule is an account that
#     exists and an application nobody ever reviewed, so "who wrote this rule and
#     what did it say" has to survive the rule being deleted.
#
# SCOPED BY THE RULE'S BATCH (decision 3), through
# `scope_views.registration_rule_scope_clause` — the READ as well as the writes.
# A college admin who could list a rule they cannot edit, with nothing on screen
# saying which is which, is worse than either alternative. The write gate is
# `_assert_rule_reachable`, which re-SELECTs through the list's own predicate
# exactly as `_assert_reachable` does for an application, and a rule naming NO
# batch hangs under nothing and belongs to the Main Admin alone.

    as it did, and keeps every `matched_rule_id` pointing at it. The client says
