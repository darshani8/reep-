/**
 * Institution structure — the Main Admin's College → Department → Course →
 * Specialization → Batch console.
 *
 * THIS IS THE FIRST CALLER OF /api/admin/*. The write layer shipped with
 * twenty operations and no screen, which meant "optional to fill in the UI"
 * was true only in the sense that mattered least — there was no UI. Every
 * level here is created, listed and edited through those endpoints; nothing
 * is built through a seed.
 *
 * ONE COLLEGE AT A TIME, TOP TO BOTTOM (2026-09-15). The screen used to be a
 * rail of indented tree rows beside a stack of detail cards, with the add
 * forms opening inside the rail. It is now the setup screen's shape: the
 * college is picked in ONE select at the top (`?college=<id>` preselects it,
 * which is how the Colleges card's "Open" lands here), and under it come five
 * sections in the spine's own order — the college and its email domains, its
 * departments, the picked department's courses (the picked course editable in
 * place), the picked course's specializations with their mock interview, and
 * the picked department's batches with seating. A department or course is a
 * bordered row that opens on press. Each level is still one fetch keyed on its
 * parent — /colleges/{id}/departments, /departments/{id}/academic-courses —
 * so the screen shows exactly what the API can answer and never a branch
 * nobody asked for.
 *
 * THIS SCREEN SEES AND CHANGES; IT DOES NOT ADD. The inline "Add college",
 * "Add department", "Add course" and "Add specialization" forms it carried
 * were the same five POSTs the setup flow makes, typed one at a time on a
 * second screen, and the owner named the repetition. Each "Add a …" here is
 * now a link into `/admin/setup?college=<id>&step=<n>`, which loads this
 * college and opens on that step. What stays is everything the setup flow
 * cannot do: edit or archive a course, map a mock interview, edit a batch,
 * add a NON-standard batch (a section, odd dates — the setup flow only writes
 * one per leaf on the academic year), seat students, and the email domains.
 *
 * THE BATCH FORM'S VALIDATORS COME FROM THE SERVER. `HierarchySchemaService`
 * fetches which of Course / Specialization is required; `buildBatchForm`
 * attaches `Validators.required` from that, and the "Required" / "Optional"
 * chip beside each select is the same flag. The word "Course" is never typed
 * in this file — it arrives as `level.label`. Flip the constant on the API and
 * this form follows with no edit.
 *
 * A BATCH IS A YEAR, AND THE FORM ASKS FOR IT AS TWO. The batch label is a
 * span — "2026-28" — and the course and the specialization it hangs off are
 * the selects below it, not part of its name. So the label is picked as a
 * Start year and an End year (`core/batch-year.ts`, which agrees with
 * `app/seed_catalogue.py`'s `batch_dates`) and composed on save, and the entry
 * and completion dates fill themselves in from the span while staying
 * editable — this screen is where a NON-STANDARD batch with odd dates is
 * added. A row whose stored label is not a span keeps the text box; see
 * `setLabelEditor`.
 *
 * GRANDFATHERED ROWS STAY EDITABLE. A batch created while a level was optional
 * is blank there after the flip. The server lists it under
 * /cohorts/incomplete, flags it in `missing_levels`, and still accepts any
 * PATCH that does not widen the gap. So this form marks the control as
 * required (the admin should know) but excludes it from the save gate (the row
 * must not be bricked) — a validator's job is to TELL, the gate's job is to
 * REFUSE, and conflating them is how a switch becomes a lockout.
 *
 * CASCADING SELECTS ENFORCE CONTIGUITY. A specialization's parent is a course,
 * so "specialization, no course" is not representable in the database. The
 * specialization select is disabled until a course is picked, and changing the
 * course clears it. The server checks the same thing (a 422 from
 * _resolve_ancestry); the cascade just makes it unreachable from here.
 *
 * WHAT THE BOARD DRAWS, AND WHAT IS BEHIND EACH PIECE OF IT (2026-09-13).
 * Three of the board's facts had no endpoint when this screen was built.
 * Phase 3 and Phase 4 have both landed and they did not land equally:
 *
 *   - the college's registration email domains (B1.1) are REAL —
 *     `colleges.email_domains`, read and written through
 *     `PATCH /api/admin/colleges/{id}`;
 *   - the specialization's INTERVIEW TRACK is REAL (B5.1). The mapping is the
 *     TRACK's field, not the specialization's, so the Track column is read
 *     from `GET /api/admin/interview-questions/tracks` and "Map track" writes
 *     `PATCH .../tracks/{id}` with `{specialization_id}`. That endpoint asks
 *     for a different capability from this screen's, so the column has THREE
 *     states and not two — see the B5.1 block below;
 *   - the course's DEGREE LEVEL and TOTAL SEMESTERS are columns that exist and
 *     are read, with no endpoint that writes them, and SEMESTERS PER YEAR is
 *     not a field anywhere. Those three boxes are plainly `disabled` with the
 *     reason on them and carry NO phase number — see `COURSE_SHAPE_REASON` and
 *     `SEMESTERS_PER_YEAR_REASON`. The batches grid still has no "semester x
 *     of N" column, and now for a sharper reason: a batch has no semester at
 *     all, a STUDENT does.
 *
 * The board's "chart colour" per track is drawn nowhere here, because there is
 * no colour on `interview_tracks` and none anywhere in `apps/api-py/app`. The
 * card's subtitle says what the mapping actually decides instead.
 *
 * Degree level on a BATCH is real today (`cohorts.degree_level`) and stays an
 * ordinary control on the batch form. It is the COURSE-level one the board
 * shows that has nothing to write to.
