# tools/ci/preflight.ps1 - run tools/ci/preflight.sh from PowerShell.
#
# WHY THIS IS A WRAPPER AND NOT A SECOND IMPLEMENTATION. The four checks that
# gate main are defined once, in .github/workflows/ci.yml, and reproduced once,
# in tools/ci/preflight.sh. A PowerShell port would be a third copy of the same
# four commands, and the copy that drifts from ci.yml is always the one nobody
# runs often enough to notice - which is worse than having no local runner at
# all, because it answers "green" about a pipeline it no longer describes. So
# this file does exactly one thing: find bash and hand over, forwarding every
# argument and the exit code unchanged.
#
# Usage (arguments are passed straight through to preflight.sh):
#   .\tools\ci\preflight.ps1
#   .\tools\ci\preflight.ps1 --quick
#   .\tools\ci\preflight.ps1 --keep-going --clean-deps
#
# Exit codes are preflight.sh's: 0 all green, 1 something failed, 2 something
# did not run.
