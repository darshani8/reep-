"""Delete ONE account for good — a student or a faculty member — from the
console, with a code the Main Admin reads out of their own mailbox.

Until 2026-09-16 the answer to "delete this student" was `python -m
app.purge_students`, which deletes every student, and the answer to "delete
this faculty account" was `python -m app.purge_people`, which deletes everyone
but the Main Admin. Both are the right tool for what they are named after and
neither can express one person. The owner asked for a Delete button on the
Students and Faculty screens with two answers behind it: REMOVE, which takes
the person off every screen and keeps every row (`users.deleted_at`, in
`routers/admin_deletion.py`), and DELETE, which is this module — the rows, the
files, the recordings, gone — guarded by a six-digit code mailed to the office
account and spent by exactly one act.

WHAT GOES is decided by the schema and by `ACCOUNT_POLICY`, through
`deletion_walk.Walk` (read its docstring first). The roots are the account's
own rows — `users`, `students`, `mentors`, the `registrations` that became or
named it, its `mail_logs` and its idempotency keys — and every `ON DELETE
CASCADE` child follows. The policy classifies the columns the schema left
undecided, and one edge it decided the other way:

  * `students.user_id`, `mentors.user_id`, `login_days.user_id` carry no
    clause because the purge modules wanted the database to REFUSE a stray
    account delete; here the row is the person's and goes with them.
  * `mentor_assignments.student_id` / `.mentor_id` and
    `student_semester_history.student_id`: history ABOUT the person, NOT NULL,
    and `purge_students` says why a row with nobody to name is not a record.
    On a FACULTY delete the assignment rows naming their group go too — the
    group row cannot survive its account — and the trail keeps the acts.
  * `redesign_mentor_notebook_*` author/owner columns are RESTRICT: the
    notebook is the faculty member's own instrument and goes with them.
  * `students.mentor_id` on a faculty delete: the mentees are RELEASED (the
    pointer cleared, counted as `mentees_released`), never deleted.
  * the four `created_by_user_id` columns on the institutional spine: cleared,
    `purge_people.CREATED_BY_COLUMNS`' reason.
  * `import_rows.student_id` is SET NULL in the schema and DELETE_ROW here: the
    line holds the student's USN, name and marks, and a delete that leaves it
    behind under a staff member's receipt has not deleted the student.
    `platform_candidates.user_id` likewise (a name and an address).

WHAT STAYS, WITHOUT THE NAME. Every `SET NULL` column is a record that outlives
the person — the audit trail, the SWOC lines they wrote (authorless is the
office's, `swoc.py`'s rule), the leave they signed, the badges they awarded —
and the plan counts them so the dialog can say so before the office presses
the button. `archived_documents` is untouched (`purge_people`'s reason: the
manifest is the only thing that can ever say whose file an archived object
was) and every stored name this delete destroys is stamped released in it.

WHAT IT REFUSES. The Main Admin account (the console's only key; a handover
is `grant_access`'s documented demotion), and — on a FACULTY delete — nothing
else: their mentees are released, their notes about students are DELETED
(`mentor_notes.mentor_id` is CASCADE and NOT NULL, so they cannot survive the
group row), and the plan says how many. Removing rather than deleting is the
answer for a faculty member whose notes the office wants to keep, and the
dialog says that too.

FILES GO BEFORE ROWS, `purge_people`'s rule applied to the subset: the stored
names are read out of the doomed rows, the bytes destroyed through the four
destroyers that module owns, and only then the transaction opens.

`tests/test_account_deletion.py` runs the real delete against the real
schema inside a transaction it rolls back, and pins the policy against every
foreign key in the metadata: a new column with no clause fails the build.
