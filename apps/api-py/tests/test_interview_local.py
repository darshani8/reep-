"""The local interview engine — the parts that must hold with no API key.

app/interview_local.py runs the same interview as the relay with nothing
leaving the machine. These tests pin the contracts that make that a drop-in
rather than a fork, and they do NO model work: loading faster-whisper and Piper
takes seconds and needs a GPU, and a suite that needs either stops being run.

What is pinned here:

1. The engine is interchangeable with the relay. Same constructor, same run()
   contract, same payload records -- because the router picks between them on
   one setting and every writer around them is shared.
2. Student text reaches the model as a MESSAGE and never as an instruction.
   That is the same line the relay draws and the reason it draws it.
3. The turn boundary. `_Vad` is the local replacement for a server VAD, so its
   thresholds decide when a student is judged to have stopped talking.
