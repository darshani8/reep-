"""The REEP Agent screen re-pointed a client at POST /api/agent/ask (2026-09).

apps/web/src/app/features/agent/ is the Knowledge-Base text helper from the
design handoff. It sends every question to /ask, reads /history, clears with
DELETE /conversation and rates answers through /feedback — which is the UI
caller that AGENT_RUNS_COLLECTED (app/routers/agent.py) was waiting for.

The contract these tests pin:

  * AGENT_RUNS_COLLECTED is True: the feedback tombstone is retired and the
    metrics payload reports a LIVE collector (collected=True, note=None).
  * /ask persists exactly one AgentRun per question, for a STUDENT and for a
    MENTOR alike, and the id it returns is that row — the screen attaches
    feedback to it, so a run_id that names nothing would 404 every rating.
  * The persisted row carries the structured answer (actions in `trace`,
    sources in `citations`) and the caller's role/scope, so the audit trail
    says what the student was shown, not just that they asked.
  * A non-student gets a 200 with the stated limitation, never a 4xx: the
    screen is routed under /student, /mentor and /director and must degrade
    honestly rather than break for staff.
  * A mentor can rate their OWN run (the ownership rule is per caller, not
    per role) and an unknown run id is the bare "Run not found." again.
