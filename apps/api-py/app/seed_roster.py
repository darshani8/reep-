"""Roster seed — the real MBA batch, and the allowlist Google sign-in checks.

    python -m alembic upgrade head
    python -m app.seed_roster                      # writes
    python -m app.seed_roster --dry-run            # shows what it would write
    python -m app.seed_roster --domain example.edu # override ROSTER_EMAIL_DOMAIN
    python -m app.seed_roster --cohort MBA-2027-A  # attach to an EXISTING cohort
    python -m app.seed_roster --rekey-domain old.edu   # the domain was wrong; move

Separate from `app.seed` for the same reason `app.seed_kb` is, and it is
deliberately NOT guarded on ENV=prod. `app.seed` refuses in production because
it creates demo accounts whose passwords are published in AGENTS.md — including
a DIRECTOR who reads every student's records. Nothing of that kind is here:
these are real students, there is no DIRECTOR, and no account created by this
module has a usable password. Production is exactly where this belongs. Under
Google-only sign-in the rows below ARE the access control — a Google account
with no `users` row is refused at the callback — so a production host without
this seed has 33 students who cannot sign in at all.

Because it is prod-runnable it says out loud, before writing, which database it
is about to write to and how many rows it is about to touch. Running a roster
against the wrong database is the failure this replaces a refusal with.

Creates, per roster row: a User (role STUDENT, no usable password) + its Student
row carrying the USN + an empty StudentProfile. The Student row is not optional
garnish: `_payload_for()` in app/api/account/sign_in.py only puts `studentId` in the
session JWT when `user.student` exists, and every /api/student/* route 403s
without it. The USN lands here so it is ALREADY FILLED IN on the profile screen
(read-only, "Synced" — a student never types it).

Data only — Alembic owns the schema.

Idempotent, and safe to re-run after a student has edited their profile:
  * keyed on the derived email (UNIQUE) and cross-checked on USN (also UNIQUE);
  * an existing account is never overwritten — only genuinely EMPTY things are
    filled in (a missing Student row, a NULL usn, a missing StudentProfile);
  * a name or USN that disagrees with the roster is reported, never corrected,
    because "the roster is newer" is an assumption and the office is the
    authority for identity changes.
