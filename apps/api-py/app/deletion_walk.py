"""The engine under the two console deletes: ONE row and everything that hangs
off it, decided by the foreign keys and by a written policy for every key that
does not decide for itself.

`app.purge_people` and `app.purge_students` empty TABLES: their verdicts are
whole-table, and that is the right shape for "hand this deployment over" and
"clear this cohort". It is the wrong shape for the Main Admin pressing Delete
on ONE student, ONE faculty account or ONE college, which is what this module
exists for (2026-09-16). Here the unit is a row, and the question is "which
other rows go with it" — a question the schema already answers for 150 of its
181 foreign keys with an ON DELETE clause. This module reads those clauses
and REFUSES TO GUESS about the rest.

HOW A ROW'S DEPENDANTS ARE FOUND. Start from the root row(s) — `users.id = ?`
for an account, `colleges.id = ?` for a college — and walk every foreign key
that points at a table already in the doomed set:

  * `ON DELETE CASCADE`   the child row goes too, and the walk continues
                          from it (a cascade's children cascade);
  * `ON DELETE SET NULL`  the child row STAYS and loses the pointer — the
                          record outlives the person, `redesign_audit_events`'
                          shape — and the walk stops there;
  * no clause, RESTRICT   the schema refuses to decide, so the POLICY must:
                          `DELETE_ROW`, `CLEAR_POINTER`, or `REFUSE_IF_ANY`
                          ("people are seated here; move them first"). A
                          column with no clause AND no policy entry aborts the
                          walk before anything is counted, let alone deleted —
                          the same "a table nobody classified aborts the run"
                          rule both purge modules keep, applied per column.

A policy may also OVERRIDE a clause the schema does carry. `import_rows.student_id`
is `SET NULL`, which keeps a spreadsheet line holding the student's USN, name
and marks after the student is gone; `account_deletion` classifies that edge
`DELETE_ROW` instead, and says why beside it.

THE PREDICATES ARE SUBQUERIES, NEVER MATERIALISED ID LISTS, and the rows are
deleted CHILDREN FIRST (`reversed(Base.metadata.sorted_tables)`, the order both
purge modules use). A child's predicate is `child.fk IN (SELECT parent.id WHERE
<parent predicate>)`, which is only true while the parent rows still exist —
so a parent is never deleted before the rows that reach through it have been.
Pointers are cleared before any row goes, for the same reason.

THE FILES ARE THE CALLER'S. This module knows rows; `account_deletion` reads
the stored names out of the doomed rows BEFORE `delete_rows` and destroys the
bytes first, which is `purge_people`'s "files go before rows" rule — a row is
the last pointer to a student's resume, and a delete that loses the pointer
first leaves bytes nobody can find.
