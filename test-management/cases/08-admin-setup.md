## TC-700 — Colleges lists every college as a card with its facts

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-700 |
| Module | Admin: Colleges |
| Priority | P1 |
| Type | Functional, positive |
| Automated test | `tests/08-admin-setup.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-700` |

### Pre-conditions

1. The web app and the API are running as described in "Setup" in the index, with the dev seed applied, so the college "BGS College of Engineering and Technology" (code `BGSCET`, campus Bengaluru) exists. It has one department on a fresh seed; other cases may add more, so note its `department_count` from `GET /api/admin/colleges` (the automated run reads it there).
2. You are signed in as the Main Admin (`admin@bgscet.ac.in`).
3. A second college exists for this case, with the campus, contact and email domain in the test data and one department under it. Create it on "Set up a college" (TC-705 shows how). The automated run creates it through the API.
4. No college is in the Draft state. The console has no control that makes a college a draft, so on a dev database none is.

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| College name | `E2E Card College <run id>` |
| Code | `E2E<run id>` (any code no other college uses) |
| Campus | `Test Campus` |
| Contact | `office-<run id>@example.invalid` |
| Email domain | `e2e-<run id>.example.invalid` |
| Department | `MGT` · Management Studies |

### Steps

1. Open `/admin/colleges`.
2. Find the card of the college in the test data.
3. Press the "Draft" status filter.
4. Press the "All" status filter.
5. Choose "Test Campus" in Campus.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 1 | The "Colleges" screen opens with one card per college. The seeded card is headed "BGS College of Engineering and Technology" and reads "BGSCET · Bengaluru · `<n>` department(s)" (the count from pre-condition 1), with the status chip "Active", "Email domains: Deployment list" (the college has named none of its own, so the deployment's list applies) and "Contact: —". The card has an "Open" link and an "Add departments, courses, batches" link. |
| ER-2 | 2 | The new college's card reads "`<code>` · Test Campus · 1 department", lists the email domain and the contact from the test data, and its "College admin" reads "Not appointed". |
| ER-3 | 3 | Both cards are hidden and the page says "No college matches this filter." |
| ER-4 | 4 | Both cards are shown again. |
| ER-5 | 5 | The new college's card stays and the Bengaluru college's card is hidden. The Campus filter is offered only when colleges sit on more than one campus. |

### Post-conditions

The new college stays on the database. Deleting a college needs a code emailed to the office (TC-704), so the automated run leaves the college in place, under a name unique to the run.

## TC-701 — A college card opens its structure and its setup

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-701 |
| Module | Admin: Colleges |
| Priority | P2 |
| Type | Functional, navigation |
| Automated test | `tests/08-admin-setup.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-701` |

### Pre-conditions

1. You are signed in as the Main Admin.
2. A college exists for this case with one department (`MGT` · Management Studies) and one course under it. The automated run creates it through the API.

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| College name | `E2E Open College <run id>` |
| Code | `E2E<run id>` |

### Steps

1. Open `/admin/colleges`.
2. On the card of the college in the test data, press "Open".
3. Go back to `/admin/colleges`.
4. On the same card, press "Add departments, courses, batches".

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 1 | The college has a card. |
| ER-2 | 2 | College structure opens at `/admin/institution?college=<college id>`, with that college chosen in the "College" picker, its name as the first section's heading, and its department "MGT Management Studies" listed under "Departments". |
| ER-3 | 3 | The card is shown again. |
| ER-4 | 4 | "Set up a college" opens at `/admin/setup?college=<college id>` on "Step 1 of 6" with that college loaded: its Code and Name are shown as facts rather than as boxes to type into, and Continue is available. |

## TC-702 — Appoint a faculty member to run a college

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-702 |
| Module | Admin: Colleges |
| Priority | P2 |
| Type | Functional, positive and negative |
| Automated test | `tests/08-admin-setup.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-702` |

### Pre-conditions

1. You are signed in as the Main Admin. The "Appoint" action is offered only to the Main Admin, who holds `admin.governance`.
2. A college exists for this case with one department, and nobody has been appointed to run it.
3. A faculty account exists that is filed under that department and runs no college. Create it on Faculty → "Add faculty member". The automated run creates both through the API.

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| College name | `E2E Appoint College <run id>` |
| Faculty account | `E2E Faculty <run id>` · `e2e-faculty-<run id>@bgscet.ac.in`, filed under the college's department |
| Short reason | `Too short` (9 characters) |
| Reason | `Runs the new college for the E2E check` |

### Steps

1. Open `/admin/colleges`.
2. On the card of the college in the test data, press "Appoint".
3. In "Faculty account", choose the faculty member in the test data.
4. Type "Too short" in "Reason".
5. Replace the reason with the one in the test data.
6. Press Appoint.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 1 | The card's "College admin" reads "Not appointed". |
| ER-2 | 2 | A form opens on the card with a "Faculty account" picker and a "Reason *" box. The help under the reason reads "0 of 20 characters", and the form's Appoint button is disabled. |
| ER-3 | 4 | The help reads "9 of 20 characters" and Appoint stays disabled: a reason must be at least 20 characters. |
| ER-4 | 5 | The help counts the new reason (38 of 20 characters) and Appoint becomes available. |
| ER-5 | 6 | The screen confirms "E2E Faculty `<run id>` appointed to E2E Appoint College `<run id>` with 14 functions." The Main Admin's appointment is live at once, so no function waits for a second approval. The card's "College admin" now names the faculty member with the chip "14 functions", and the form closes. |

### Post-conditions

The faculty account holds 14 functions scoped to the new college. Revoke them in "Who can do what" when the case is done, and remove the account from Faculty. The automated run revokes every grant and removes the account through the API.

## TC-703 — Deleting a college that still has people under it is refused

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-703 |
| Module | Admin: Colleges |
| Priority | P1 |
| Type | Functional, negative |
| Automated test | `tests/08-admin-setup.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-703` |

### Pre-conditions

1. You are signed in as the Main Admin. "Delete college…" is offered to the Main Admin alone.
2. The dev seed's student, Test Student, is seated in the seeded batch `MBA-2026-B` of "BGS College of Engineering and Technology" and filed under its department. Other cases may have approved more students into that batch, filed faculty under the college or left an application open; that changes the numbers in the refusal, not the refusal itself. Note the number of students seated in the college's batches from `GET /api/admin/colleges/<college id>/delete-plan` (`blockers["students.cohort_id"]`; the automated run reads it there). On a freshly seeded database it is 1.

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| College | BGS College of Engineering and Technology (`BGSCET`) |
| Reason | `Checking the refusal` |
| Code | `123456` (any six digits; nothing is sent) |

### Steps

1. Open `/admin/colleges`.
2. On the "BGS College of Engineering and Technology" card, press "Delete college…".
3. Type "Checking the refusal" in "Reason" and "123456" in "Code from your email".
4. Press Cancel.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 1 | The seeded college has a card. |
| ER-2 | 2 | A dialog headed "Delete BGSCET · BGS College of Engineering and Technology" opens. It lists what would go and shows the server's refusal word for word. The refusal starts "BGSCET still has people attached:", counts the students seated in its batches as "`<n>` student(s) seated in its batches" with the number noted in pre-condition 2 (at least 1, Test Student), names anything else filed under the college (students filed under its departments, faculty accounts, open applications), and ends "Move them to another college first (Students and Faculty screens) and decide the open applications; nothing was changed." The "Delete this college for good" button is disabled. |
| ER-3 | 3 | "Delete this college for good" stays disabled. For a college that may be deleted, a reason and six digits are what enable it; a refused college cannot be deleted whatever is typed. Do not press "Email me a code": no code is needed for this case. |
| ER-4 | 4 | The dialog closes and the college is still listed. |

## TC-704 — Delete an empty college with the code emailed to the office

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-704 |
| Module | Admin: Colleges |
| Priority | P2 |
| Type | Functional, positive |
| Automated test | None (manual only): the delete needs the six-digit code emailed to the office account, and reading a mailbox or the API's log is not something a browser test may do. |

### Pre-conditions

1. You are signed in as the Main Admin, and you can read the mailbox of `admin@bgscet.ac.in`. On a development server with no mail transport, the API logs each email to its console instead.
2. A college exists that nobody is filed under: no student seated in its batches or filed under its departments, no faculty account filed under it, and no application waiting in the review queue. A college made on "Set up a college" for this case, with one department, is enough.
3. Fewer than the hourly limit of deletion codes have been requested by this account in the last hour.

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| College | `E2E Delete College <date>`, set up for this case |
| Reason | `Made for a test and no longer needed` |

### Steps

1. Open `/admin/colleges`.
2. On the card of the college in the test data, press "Delete college…".
3. Type the reason in "Reason".
4. Press "Email me a code".
5. Type the six-digit code from the email in "Code from your email".
6. Press "Delete this college for good".

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 2 | A dialog headed "Delete `<code>` · `<name>`" lists what would go (for example "1 department") and shows no refusal. "Delete this college for good" is disabled. |
| ER-2 | 4 | **Manual only.** A note confirms the code was sent, the link now reads "Send another code", and an email with a six-digit code reaches the office account's own address. |
| ER-3 | 5 | "Delete this college for good" becomes available once the reason and a six-digit code are both typed. |
| ER-4 | 6 | The dialog closes, the screen shows the server's confirmation, and the college's card is gone from the list. |

### Post-conditions

The college, its departments, courses, specializations and batches are deleted for good. There is no undo.

| Department | Code `MGT`, Name `Management Studies`, Head `Dr. Test Head` |
| Course | Code `MBA`, Name `General MBA`, Degree PG, Years 2 |
| Specializations | Code `fa`, Name `Financial Analytics`; Code `mkt`, Name `Marketing` |
| Starting year | 2026 |

### Steps

1. Open `/admin/setup`.
2. Type the Code and Name from the test data.
3. Type the Campus, Contact and Email domains from the test data, then press Continue.
4. Type the department's Code, Name and Head, then press Continue.
5. Press "Add a course", type the course's Code and Name, keep Degree PG and Years 2, then press Continue.
6. Press "Add a specialization" twice, type the two specializations from the test data, then press Continue.
7. Choose 2026 in "Starting year".
8. Press Continue.
9. Press "Create everything · 7".
10. Open `/admin/colleges` and find the new college's card.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 1 | "Set up a college" opens on "Step 1 of 6" with "— New college —" chosen in "Continue a college that is already here". Continue is disabled. |

| ER-6 | 6 | "Step 5 of 6" shows one batch per specialization: "General MBA · Financial Analytics" and "General MBA · Marketing". |
| ER-7 | 7 | The Financial Analytics batch reads Code "`<code>`-MGT-MBA-FA-2026-28", Reads as "General MBA - Financial Analytics · 2026-28", Runs "2026-07-01 → 2028-06-30" and Degree "PG", with the chip "Mock interview: Financial Analytics (FA)", because its code `fa` matches that track. The Marketing batch's code is "`<code>`-MGT-MBA-MKT-2026-28" and its chip reads "Mock interview: general", because no track uses the code `mkt`. |
| ER-8 | 8 | "Step 6 of 6" lists what will be written, each marked "New": "`<code>` · E2E Setup College `<run id>`", "MGT · Management Studies", "MBA · General MBA · PG · 2 years", "fa · Financial Analytics", "mkt · Marketing" and the two batches with their codes and "Reads as" text. The button reads "Create everything · 7". |
| ER-9 | 9 | All seven rows read "Created", the screen says "E2E Setup College `<run id>` is set up.", and it offers "Open College structure", "Approve new students" and "Set up another college". |
| ER-10 | 10 | The new college's card reads "`<code>` · Test Campus · 1 department" and lists the email domain and the contact. |

### Post-conditions

The college, its department, course, two specializations and two batches stay on the database (see TC-704 for why a college is not deleted afterwards).

### Pre-conditions

1. You are signed in as the Main Admin.
2. The dev seed's institution keeps the names, codes and dates the seed gave it: department `MGMT` "Department of Management Studies" (head Dr. Kavya N) with course `MBA` "Master of Business Administration" (24 months), specialization `FIN` "Finance" with no interview track mapped to it, and batch `MBA-2026-B` (label 2024-26, named "2024-26 Section B", ending 31 July 2026) with Test Student seated in it.
3. Other cases may have added to it: students approved into `MBA-2026-B`, faculty filed under `MGMT`, more batches. So the COUNTS below are not fixed. Before you start, note them from the API (the automated run reads them): the college's department count (`GET /api/admin/colleges`), `MGMT`'s batch count, `MBA`'s specialization count, `FIN`'s batch count and the number of students seated in `MBA-2026-B` (the `…/departments`, `…/academic-courses`, `…/academic-specializations` and `…/departments/<MGMT id>/cohorts` reads under `/api/admin`). On a freshly seeded database each is 1.

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| College | BGSCET · BGS College of Engineering and Technology |
| Search words | `Finance`, then `no-such-thing` |

### Steps

1. Open `/admin/institution` and choose "BGSCET · BGS College of Engineering and Technology" in "College".
2. Under "Departments", press "MGMT Department of Management Studies", then under "Courses", press "MBA Master of Business Administration".
3. Type "Finance" in "Find".
4. Replace it with "no-such-thing".

The course reads "MBA Master of Business Administration 24 months · `<n>` specialization(s)" and is open for editing under the heading "MBA · Master of Business Administration", with Months "24". "Specializations" lists "FIN · Finance" with the mock interview "Not mapped" and its batch count. "Batches" lists `MBA-2026-B`, reading "Master of Business Administration - Finance · 2024-26 Section B", with "MBA · FIN", the number of students seated in it (Test Student among them), and the end date "31 Jul 2026". |
| ER-3 | 3 | The finder narrows every section below the college: "Departments" reads "Nothing matches “Finance”.", while the Finance specialization and the batch (found through its course and specialization) still show. |
| ER-4 | 4 | "Batches" reads "None of the `<n>` batch(es) under MGMT match “no-such-thing”." and the batch row is hidden. |

## TC-711 — Edit and archive a course

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-711 |
| Module | Admin: College structure |
| Priority | P2 |
| Type | Functional, positive and negative |
| Automated test | `tests/08-admin-setup.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-711` |

### Pre-conditions

1. You are signed in as the Main Admin.
2. A college exists for this case with department `MGT` and course `MBA` "General MBA" (24 months, Active) and nothing else. The automated run creates it through the API. Use a college made for the case, not the seeded one: an archived course cannot be un-archived from this screen's Archive button.

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| College | `E2E Course College <run id>` |
| New name | `General MBA (Revised)` |
| New length | 18 months |

### Steps

1. Open `/admin/institution` and choose the college in the test data in "College".
2. Change Name to "General MBA (Revised)" and Months to 18, then press "Save changes".
3. Clear the Name box.
4. Press Archive.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 1 | The course is open for editing under "MBA · General MBA", with Name "General MBA", Months "24" and Status "Active". |
| ER-2 | 2 | The screen says "Saved course MBA" and the course row reads "MBA General MBA (Revised) 18 months · 0 specializations". |
| ER-3 | 3 | "Save changes" is disabled: a course cannot be saved without a name. |
| ER-4 | 4 | The screen says "Archived course MBA". The course row carries an "Archived" chip, Status reads "Archived", the Name box shows the stored "General MBA (Revised)" again (the cleared name was never saved), and Archive is disabled. |

### Post-conditions

The course stays archived under a college made for the case.

### Pre-conditions

1. You are signed in as the Main Admin, who holds `admin.institution` and `admin.interview_questions`.
2. A college exists for this case with department `MGT`, course `MBA` and specialization `OPS` "Operations".
3. An interview track made for this case exists and is mapped to nothing. Add it on Interview questions with "Add track" (TC-745). The automated run creates both through the API. A track made for the case keeps the shipped four untouched: mapping a track to a specialization also files it under that specialization's college.

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| College | `E2E Mapping College <run id>` |
| Track | Code `t<run id>`, Name `E2E Track <run id>` |

### Steps

1. Open `/admin/institution` and choose the college in the test data in "College".
2. Press "Map mock interview".
3. Choose the track in the test data in "Mock interview" and "OPS · Operations" in "For", then press Save.
4. Press "Map mock interview" again, choose the same track, choose "Every specialization" in "For", then press Save.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 1 | "Specializations" lists "OPS · Operations" with the mock interview "Not mapped" and 0 batches. |
| ER-2 | 2 | A panel opens with a "Mock interview" picker, listing tracks as "Name (code)", and a "For" picker offering "Every specialization" and "OPS · Operations". |
| ER-3 | 3 | The screen says "E2E Track `<run id>` is the interview for OPS.", the Operations row shows the track's name instead of "Not mapped", and the panel closes. |
| ER-4 | 4 | Choosing the track opens "For" on its current mapping, OPS · Operations. After Save the screen says "E2E Track `<run id>` is offered to every specialization again." and the row reads "Not mapped" again. |

### Post-conditions

Remove the track on Interview questions when done. The automated run deletes it through the API.

5. Press Edit on the new batch.
6. Change Name to "2026-28 Section Y", then press Save.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 1 | "Batches" reads "No batch under MGT yet." |
| ER-2 | 2 | The "New batch" form opens. "End year" is disabled with "Needs a start year first.", Specialization is disabled until a course is chosen, and "Create batch" is disabled. |

### Pre-conditions

1. You are signed in as the Main Admin.
2. Test Student (`student@bgscet.ac.in`, USN `1BG24MBA001`, stage Excel-Advanced) is seated in the seeded batch `MBA-2026-B`, as the dev seed leaves them. Other cases may have seated more students there: note the batch's Students count before step 3 (the automated run reads it from `GET /api/admin/cohorts/<batch id>/students`). On a freshly seeded database it is 1.

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| College | BGSCET · BGS College of Engineering and Technology |
| Batch | `MBA-2026-B` |
| Student | Test Student · 1BG24MBA001 |

| ER-2 | 2 | A panel "Students in MBA-2026-B" opens, listing Test Student with `student@bgscet.ac.in`, USN `1BG24MBA001` and stage "Excel-Advanced". "Add a student" does not offer Test Student, who is already seated. |
| ER-3 | 3 | The screen says "Test Student released from MBA-2026-B.", Test Student leaves the panel (on a fresh database it then reads "Nobody in this batch yet."), the batch's Students count drops by exactly one to `<n>` − 1, and "Add a student" now offers "Test Student · 1BG24MBA001". |
| ER-4 | 4 | The screen says "Test Student seated in MBA-2026-B.", Test Student is listed again and the Students count is back to `<n>`. |

### Post-conditions

Test Student is back in `MBA-2026-B`, as the seed left them. If the case is abandoned after step 3, seat the student again (step 4); the automated run always does so through the API.

### Pre-conditions

1. You are signed in as the Main Admin, who holds `admin.catalogue`.
2. The dev seed's two subjects are as the seed left them: `22MBA11` "Management & Organisational Behaviour" (Instructor Led, Professional, Excel, semester 1, 40 h taught + 20 h self-study, 16 weeks, with the certification "Leadership Foundations") and `22MBA12` "Managerial Economics" (Teaching Plus Self Learn, Thinking, Excel, semester 1, 40 + 20 h, 16 weeks, no certification), each with Test Student enrolled.
3. How many students are enrolled in each, and how many subjects mention "Economics", can change as other cases run. Note them from `GET /api/admin/catalogue` (the automated run reads them there). On a fresh database each subject has 1 student and one subject mentions "Economics".

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Search words | `Economics`, then `no-such-subject` |

### Steps

1. Open `/admin/catalogue`.
2. Type "Economics" in the subject search.
3. Replace it with "no-such-subject".

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |

### Pre-conditions

1. You are signed in as the Main Admin. An import is a programme-wide change, so a grant scoped to one college is refused.
2. No subject uses the code in the test data.

### Test data

Two UTF-8 CSV files. `<code>` is a subject code no other subject uses (the automated run uses `E2ESUB<run id>`), and `<name>` is `E2E Subject <run id>`.

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `subjects-new.csv` | `code,name,stage,dimension,semester,model_type,teaching_hours,self_learning_hours_required` then `<code>,<name>,EXCEL,PROFESSIONAL,2,INSTRUCTOR_LED,30,10` |
| `subjects-renamed.csv` | The same header, then `<code>,<name> (renamed),EXCEL,PROFESSIONAL,2,INSTRUCTOR_LED,30,10` |

### Steps

1. Open `/admin/catalogue` and press "Import subjects".
2. Choose the first CSV in the test data with "Choose a CSV".
3. Press "Check first".
4. Press Import.
5. Choose the second CSV in the test data with "Choose a CSV", then press "Check first".

| ER-2 | 2 | The file name is shown. "Check first" becomes available; "Import" stays disabled until a dry run has reported. |
| ER-3 | 3 | The report reads "Dry run · 1 to add, 0 to update, 0 in error. Nothing has been written yet." with line 2, the code and the outcome "create". The subject is not in the table yet, and "Import" becomes available. |
| ER-4 | 4 | The screen says "1 subject added, 0 updated.", the report reads "Imported · 1 to add, 0 to update, 0 in error." and the Subjects table lists "`<code>` · `<name>`" with "Instructor Led · 16 weeks", Professional, Excel, semester 2, 40 hours, 0 enrolled and "None mapped". |
| ER-5 | 5 | The dry run reads "Dry run · 0 to add, 1 to update, 0 in error." with line 2 marked "update". |
| ER-6 | 6 | The screen says "0 subjects added, 1 updated." and the subject now reads "`<code>` · `<name>` (renamed)". |

### Post-conditions

The subject stays in the catalogue: the console has no way to delete a subject, which is a code shared by every college. The automated run uses a new code each run.

## TC-727 — Interview tracks are listed read-only on the Catalogue

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-727 |
| Module | Admin: Catalogue |
| Priority | P3 |
| Type | Functional, data display |
| Automated test | `tests/08-admin-setup.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-727` |

### Pre-conditions

1. You are signed in as the Main Admin, who holds `admin.interview_questions`. Without it, the tab says the account cannot open Interview questions.
2. The four shipped interview tracks exist, as the dev seed leaves them.

### Test data

None.

### Steps

1. Open `/admin/catalogue` and open the "Interview tracks" tab.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 1 | The tab lists "Human Resources (HR)" (key `hr`), "Digital Marketing (DM)" (`dm`), "Business Analytics (BA)" (`ba`) and "Financial Analytics (FA)" (`fa`), each running the phases "opening · probing · deep_dive · wrap_up", with their question counts. It says "Read-only here. Tracks are edited on Interview questions." and offers no button. |

## TC-728 — Copy one programme’s catalogue into another

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-728 |
| Module | Admin: Catalogue |
| Priority | P2 |
| Type | Functional, positive |
| Automated test | `tests/08-admin-setup.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-728` |

### Pre-conditions

1. You are signed in as the Main Admin.
2. Two colleges exist for this case, each with course `MBA` "General MBA" under a department "Management Studies". The source course has one stage rule (semester 2 is Excel) and one approved certification pinned to it (`E2E Programme Certificate <run id>`, for the badge SQL); the destination has neither. The automated run creates all of it through the API.

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Copy from | MBA — General MBA · `E2E Copy From <run id>` |
| Copy into | MBA — General MBA · `E2E Copy To <run id>` |

### Steps

1. Open `/admin/catalogue`, open the "Certifications ↔ badges" tab and press "Copy to course…".
2. Choose the source programme in "Copy from" and the destination in "Copy into".
3. Press "Check first".
4. Press Copy.
5. Open the "Stage rules" tab and choose the destination programme in "Programme".

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 1 | The panel "Copy a catalogue between programmes" opens with "Approved certifications", "Badge map" and "Stage rules" ticked, and "Check first" is disabled. |
| ER-2 | 2 | Under the source it reads "E2E Copy From `<run id>` · Management Studies — 1 certification · 0 badge overrides · 1 stage rule", and under the destination "E2E Copy To `<run id>` · Management Studies — 0 certifications · 0 badge overrides · 0 stage rules". Copy is disabled until a dry run has reported. |
| ER-3 | 3 | The dry run reads "certifications: 1 copied, 0 already there" and "stage_rules: 1 copied, 0 already there", ending "— nothing has been written." |
| ER-4 | 4 | The screen says "2 rows copied into MBA · E2E Copy To `<run id>`." |
| ER-5 | 5 | The destination programme now has the rule: semester 2 is "Excel". |

### Post-conditions

Remove both programmes' stage rules on the Stage rules tab, and remove both certifications (TC-724). The automated run does both through the API.

## TC-730 — Interview records lists a student’s mock interview, and the filters narrow it

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-730 |
| Module | Admin: Interview records |
| Priority | P1 |
| Type | Functional, data display and filter |
| Automated test | `tests/08-admin-setup.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-730` |

### Pre-conditions

1. You are signed in as the Main Admin, who holds `admin.interviews`.
2. Test Student has taken at least one mock interview on the Human Resources track: signed in as the student, open `/student/assistant`, accept the interview terms if asked, choose Human Resources and press Start. The automated run opens the same interview socket from a second browser signed in as the student.
3. The API runs with no AWS credentials, as a development server does, so the interviewer cannot reach Amazon Bedrock: the interview is recorded and ends at once as Failed. Other interviews may be on record from other cases; the case follows the one just taken, which is the newest (the list is sorted by Started, newest first). Before steps 3 and 5, note how many interviews `GET /api/admin/interviews?status=completed` and `?track=dm` list (the automated run reads them there; on a development server both are usually 0).
4. Test Student has not used up the day's 20 interview attempts (TC-735 gives them back).

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Student | Test Student · USN `1BG24MBA001` |
| Track | Human Resources (HR) |

### Steps

1. Open `/admin/interviews`.
2. Choose "Failed" in Status.
3. Choose "Completed" in Status.
4. Choose "All" in Status.
5. Choose "Digital Marketing" in Track.
6. Choose "Human Resources" in Track.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 1 | "Interview records" lists the interview just taken with USN `1BG24MBA001`, Student "Test Student", Track "HR", Score "—" (not scored, which is not a zero) and Audio "No audio". |
| ER-2 | 2 | The interview is still listed: it ended as Failed. |
| ER-3 | 3 | The interview is not listed. The list holds exactly the completed interviews noted before the step ("Rows: `<n>`"), or reads "No interview matches these filters." when there are none. |
| ER-4 | 4 | The interview is listed again. |
| ER-5 | 5 | The interview is not listed. The list holds exactly the Digital Marketing interviews noted before the step, or reads "No interview matches these filters." when there are none. |
| ER-6 | 6 | The HR interview is listed again. |

Wait for the list to change after each step before choosing the next filter (see "Known defect").

### Post-conditions

The interview stays on the student's record until the retention sweep removes it (180 days by default). It used one of the student's 20 attempts for the day.

### Known defect

The screen shows whichever list answers LAST, not the one for the filters now chosen. Changing two filters in quick succession (Status to "All", then at once Track to "Digital Marketing") left the grid and the tiles showing all 13 interviews under a Track filter reading "Digital Marketing", in one automated run of this case: the slower "All" answer arrived after the "Digital Marketing" one and replaced it. `reload()` → `loadRecords()` and `loadSummary()` in `apps/web/src/app/features/admin/interviews/interviews.component.ts` write every answer into `records` and `kpis` without checking that it belongs to the filters still in force. The automated test waits for each list before the next change, as a person watching the screen would, so it does not trip on this.

| Module | Admin: Interview records |
| Priority | P1 |
| Type | Functional, data display |
| Automated test | `tests/08-admin-setup.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-731` |

### Pre-conditions

1. As TC-730's pre-conditions 1 to 4: an HR interview by Test Student that failed because the interviewer could not be reached, with nothing said.
2. The API's `INTERVIEW_RECORDING_ENABLED` is off, a development server's default.

### Test data

| ER-2 | 2 | A record opens under the list, headed "Test Student" with the line "1BG24MBA001 · Human Resources · `<started>` · `<m:ss>`". It shows the chips "Failed" and "No audio" and no "Download recording" button, and it says why there is no audio: "Voice recording is switched off on this server (INTERVIEW_RECORDING_ENABLED), so no college can record until the operator turns it on." A line reads "Ended: `<reason>` · stopped in opening · 0 answers counted · 0 turns, 0 saved". The Report tab says "No readable report (unavailable). The transcript is still saved." and "Score over time" counts the student's whole history, "`<n>` interview(s) · `<s>` scored" (every interview Test Student has on record, and how many have a score: 0 on a server without Bedrock). |
| ER-3 | 3 | The Transcript tab says "No turns were saved for this interview." |
| ER-4 | 4 | The record closes. |

| Priority | P1 |
| Type | Functional, positive (edit and restore) |
| Automated test | `tests/08-admin-setup.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-733` |

### Pre-conditions

1. You are signed in as the Main Admin, who holds `admin.interviews` and `admin.institution` (the policy card's college list needs the second).
2. A college exists for this case and nobody has set its interview policy. The automated run creates it through the API. The case can be run on the seeded college instead, but a policy once saved cannot be un-configured from the console, so the seeded college would read "Configured" from then on.
3. The API's `INTERVIEW_RECORDING_ENABLED` is off and the deployment defaults are unchanged (transcripts kept, 180 days, 480 seconds, 8 completed and 20 attempts a day).

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| College | `E2E Policy College <run id>` |

### Steps

1. Open `/admin/interviews` and choose the college in the test data in the policy card’s "College".
2. Tick "Allow voice recording" and press "Save policy".
3. Reload the page and choose the college again.
4. Untick "Allow voice recording" and press "Save policy".
5. Reload the page and choose the college again.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 1 | The card reads "Not configured" and "deployment defaults", and says "Voice recording is switched off on this server (INTERVIEW_RECORDING_ENABLED). “Allow voice recording” below records nothing until the operator turns it on." "Keep the transcript" is ticked, "Allow voice recording" is not, and the boxes read Keep for 180 days, Time limit 480 seconds, 8 completed per day and 20 attempts per day. |
| ER-2 | 2 | The card says "Saved. Applies to interviews started from now on." and now reads "Configured", "last changed by Main Admin (seed)". |
| ER-3 | 3 | The card reads "Configured" with "Allow voice recording" ticked: the policy was stored. |
| ER-4 | 4 | The card says "Saved. Applies to interviews started from now on." again. |
| ER-5 | 5 | "Allow voice recording" is unticked, and the college keeps a stored policy ("Configured"). |

### Post-conditions

The college's policy is stored with voice recording off, as the deployment default had it.

### Pre-conditions

1. You are signed in as the Main Admin, who holds `admin.student_records` (to open the record) and `admin.interviews` (to reset the cap).
2. Note the two ceilings that govern Test Student: the MBA course's row on BGSCET's interview policy, else the college's own row, else the deployment's defaults (8 completed and 20 attempts a day). `GET /api/admin/interview-policies/<college id>` shows all three; the automated run reads them there. On a fresh database no policy is set and the defaults apply.
3. Test Student has no interview running.

### Test data

| Field | Value |

| ER-2 | 2 | A box asks "Why are you giving these attempts back?" and says "Attempts already counted are kept; the count restarts from now." "Give the attempts back" is disabled. |
| ER-3 | 3 | "Give the attempts back" stays disabled: blank is not a reason. |
| ER-4 | 4 | "Give the attempts back" becomes available. |
| ER-5 | 5 | The screen says "Test Student may practise again — the 24-hour window is now counted from `<dd Mon yyyy, hh:mm>`, and your reason is on the audit trail." "Interview cap today" reads "0 of `<daily ceiling>` completed · 0 of `<attempt ceiling>` attempts · counted from `<the same time>`" with the ceilings from pre-condition 2 ("0 of 8 completed · 0 of 20 attempts" by default), and the box closes. |

### Post-conditions

The reset and its reason are on the audit trail. The student's count for the next 24 hours starts from the reset.

| ER-2 | 2 | The browser asks "Remove this question?" and, answered Cancel, the question stays. |
| ER-3 | 3 | The screen says "Question removed.", the card reads "No question on this track yet." and the track's tab counts 0. |

### Post-conditions

Remove the track made for the case (TC-746). The automated run deletes it through the API.

## TC-746 — Add a track, improve it and remove it

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-746 |
| Module | Admin: Interview questions |
| Priority | P1 |
| Type | Functional, positive (add, edit, delete) |
| Automated test | `tests/08-admin-setup.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-746` |

### Pre-conditions

1. You are signed in as the Main Admin.
2. No track uses the code in the test data. No interview has ever been held on it: a track that has run an interview can only be switched off, not removed.

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Code | `ops<run id>` (2 to 20 lower-case letters, digits, `-` or `_`, starting with a letter) |
| Name | `E2E Operations <run id>` |
| Interviewer role | `an exacting but fair Head of Operations` |
| Sample question | `Walk me through how you would cut a supplier lead time by a week.` |
| Frameworks | `SIPOC, OEE`, then `SIPOC, OEE, root-cause analysis, Little’s Law` |
| Voice | matthew |

### Steps

1. Open `/admin/interview-questions` and press "Add track".
2. Type the Code, Name, Interviewer role, Sample question and the two Frameworks from the test data, and choose "matthew" in Voice.
3. Press "Create track".
4. Replace Frameworks with the four in the test data and press Save.
5. Press Remove and answer OK to the browser’s question.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 1 | A "New track" card opens and "Create track" is disabled. |
| ER-2 | 2 | "Create track" becomes available. |
| ER-3 | 3 | The screen says "Track created." and the new track has its own tab, selected, counting 0 questions. Its card shows the code in capitals, "Every college" and "Offered". The server advises without refusing: "Saved, with a note:" then "Only 2 framework(s). PROBING and DEEP_DIVE work through these one at a time; the shipped tracks carry 4 or more, and a track with fewer runs out of interview before wrap-up." |
| ER-4 | 4 | The screen says "Track saved." and the note is gone. |
| ER-5 | 5 | The browser asks "Remove the E2E Operations `<run id>` track? Its questions stay in the bank." After OK the screen says "Track removed." and the track's tab is gone. |

## TC-747 — Move a question down the interviewer’s order

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-747 |
| Module | Admin: Interview questions |
| Priority | P3 |
| Type | Functional, positive |
| Automated test | `tests/08-admin-setup.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-747` |

### Pre-conditions

1. You are signed in as the Main Admin.
2. A track made for the case holds two questions in this order: "Walk me through your background and why operations." (Opening) and "Describe a time you cut waste from a process." (Probing).

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Track | `E2E Order <run id>` |
| Search word | `waste` |

### Steps

1. Open `/admin/interview-questions` and press the tab of the track in the test data.
2. Press "Move this question down" on row 1.
3. Type "waste" in the question search.
4. Reload the page and press the tab of the track again.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 1 | The two questions are listed in that order. Row 1's "Move this question up" and row 2's "Move this question down" are disabled. |
| ER-2 | 1 | **Manual only.** Each row's two move buttons show an up arrow and a down arrow, so a sighted user can tell them apart. |
| ER-3 | 2 | The two questions swap places. |
| ER-4 | 3 | The move buttons are disabled while the list is filtered, and hovering one says "Clear the search to reorder — the order covers the whole track". |
| ER-5 | 4 | The new order was stored. |

### Post-conditions

As TC-741's.

### Known defect

Seen by hand; the automated test cannot see it. The two move buttons render as narrow empty buttons with no arrow on them: commit `a7ff923` removed every `expand_more` glyph from the templates, and those glyphs were the only content of these buttons (`interview-questions.component.html`, the two `bank-icon-btn` buttons before "Remove this question"). They still work and keep their accessible names, which is why the automated test passes.

## TC-750 — A faculty member cannot open the college setup and interview screens

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-750 |
| Module | Admin: access |
| Priority | P1 |
| Type | Security, negative |
| Automated test | `tests/08-admin-setup.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-750` |

### Pre-conditions

1. You are signed in as the dev seed's faculty member, Test Mentor (`mentor@bgscet.ac.in` / `mentor123`).
2. Nobody has granted Test Mentor any `admin.*` function in "Who can do what", and Test Mentor runs no college (TC-702 appoints a different account).

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Screens | `/admin/colleges`, `/admin/setup`, `/admin/institution`, `/admin/catalogue`, `/admin/interviews`, `/admin/interview-questions` |

### Steps

1. Open `/admin/colleges`.
2. Open `/admin/setup`, `/admin/institution`, `/admin/catalogue`, `/admin/interviews` and `/admin/interview-questions` in turn.
3. Open `/api/admin/colleges` in the same browser.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 1 | The app sends the faculty member to their own home, `/mentor/notebook` ("Faculty notebook"), and the sidebar offers no Colleges screen. |
| ER-2 | 2 | Every address lands on `/mentor/notebook` in the same way. |
| ER-3 | 3 | The API itself refuses, whatever the screen does: it answers 403 with `{"detail":"You do not hold the 'Institution hierarchy' capability. An administrator can grant it in Governance."}` |
