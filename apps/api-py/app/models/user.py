"""Auth-critical models — the first slice of the fresh Python schema.

This is deliberately small: enough to authenticate and mint the same session
payload the Next.js app does (userId, email, name, role, studentId?, mentorId?).
The remaining ~35 models are ported in later phases (see

    # A student's college, department, course and batch are reached THROUGH one

    # routers/student.py::_institution_for). Faculty had no such pointer at all:
    # the only institutional thing on a staff row was `department` above, a FREE
    # TEXT string typed on a form, so "Dept of Management Studies", "DMS" and
    # "Management" were three departments to anybody trying to group by one, and
    # no staff row could name its college at all. With more than one college in
    # `colleges` that is not a tidiness problem — it is the difference between
    # being able to say which institution a person belongs to and not.
    #
    # ON `users`, NOT ON `mentors`, and that placement is forced: a faculty
    # account deliberately has no `Mentor` row until the Main Admin assigns it a
    # student (see routers/console.py and AGENTS.md). Hanging the department off
    # `mentors` would mean a newly created faculty member — the exact row the
    # admin is trying to file — had nowhere to record where they work.

    # is a separate act; this column is the source of truth wherever it is set.
