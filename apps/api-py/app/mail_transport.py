"""How an email actually leaves the building. Amazon SES, or the console.

THE DRIVER `app/mailer.py` LEFT A HOLE FOR. That module guarantees a message is
sent at most once per dedupe key and takes a `send(recipient, subject)`
callable; it says plainly that the transport is out of its scope. This is the
transport. The whole choice of provider lives in `send()` — swapping SES for
the college's SMTP relay later is this file, not a project.

WHY SES. The deciding factor is not price (at a college's volume every option
is effectively free); it is that SES needs NO CREDENTIAL. It authenticates
through the same task role that already reaches Bedrock for the interviewer,
so there is nothing to paste, leak or rotate — where every other provider adds
an API key someone has to store, and puts student email addresses in a third
party's systems. There are three settings and no credential among them:
`SES_FROM_ADDRESS`, `SES_CONFIGURATION_SET`, and `SES_REGION`, which falls
back to the AWS environment like everything else here.

WHERE THIS STANDS (2026-09-15). The sandbox is behind us. `sast-skills.com` is
verified with DKIM signing, the account holds production access in ap-south-1,
and `SES_FROM_ADDRESS=no-reply@sast-skills.com` reached the running api task at
13:55 UTC that day — before which every task in every revision booted saying
"NO TRANSPORT" and this module's console path was the whole story. The
institution's own `bgscet.ac.in` was NOT taken to verification: the deployment
sends as sast-skills.com by decision, and docs/ses-mail.md records why and what
moving would cost. Nothing here was ever blocked on any of it — the on-screen
activation link and the console transport below both work without SES, which is
why an unverified domain was never an outage.

THE CONFIGURATION SET IS NAMED ON THE CALL, NOT INHERITED. `send()` passes
`settings.ses_configuration_set` when it is set, and the alternative is worse
than it looks: SES also applies the set attached to the IDENTITY as its
default, so tracking that is inherited disappears the day someone edits the
identity, with every send still succeeding and both reputation alarms sitting at
INSUFFICIENT_DATA looking like a quiet week. A named set cannot fail quietly —
SES refuses a send naming one that does not exist. The setting's own comment in
config.py carries the full reasoning.

THE CONSOLE TRANSPORT IS NOT A STUB, AND IT IS NOT LEGACY EITHER. With
`SES_FROM_ADDRESS` blank — every development machine, every CI run, and any
deployment that has not been given an identity — a
message is logged in full and kept in `outbox`, a bounded in-memory list. A
developer reads the activation link out of the uvicorn log; the test suite
reads it out of `outbox`. It is bounded and only ever filled when no real
transport exists, so it never becomes a copy of student mail sitting in a
production process.

AND IT ASKS WHETHER THE ADDRESS CAN RECEIVE ANYTHING (2026-09-17). Accepting a
message is not delivering it. A hard bounce or a complaint puts an address on
SES's ACCOUNT SUPPRESSION LIST, and from then on SES takes every send for it,
returns a message id, and delivers nothing — so `deliver_once` writes SENT and
every screen in the product tells that student "we have emailed you a code",
for ever. It was reported from production as a student who could sign in with
Google and never received a code by any route, and nothing here could see it,
because there was no failure to see. `suppression_for` is the question, asked
immediately before the send; `SuppressedRecipient` is what a suppressed address
raises INSTEAD of being sent, which turns the one silent failure in this module
into the FAILED row, the `error` sentence and the CloudWatch line that every
other mail failure already produced. The office reads those on `/admin/mail`
and lifts the suppression from there.

RULE 1 (student data must not leave the machine unbidden) is not engaged: an
activation or reset email carries a name and a link, never a mark, a USN or a
transcript. Keep it that way — do not put a student's record in an email.
