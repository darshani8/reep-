"""Give one existing account a usable password.

    python -m app.set_password someone@bgscet.ac.in

The password is TYPED AT A PROMPT, never passed as a flag. A `--password` option
would put the secret in the operator's shell history, in `ps` output for every
other user on the box, and — on the ECS path this is most likely run through —
in the task definition overrides that CloudTrail records. There is deliberately
no way to supply it non-interactively; a tool that can be scripted with a
password in the command is a tool whose passwords end up in a log.

WHY THIS EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM app.grant_access. Sign-in is Google-first, and
every account minted by `app.grant_access` and `app.seed_roster` carries
SSO_ONLY_PASSWORD_HASH — a sentinel that is not `scrypt:<salt>:<digest>`, so
`verify_password` returns False for every password ever tried. That is why
setting PASSWORD_LOGIN=true does not by itself let anybody in: the door opens,
and every account behind it still has no key. This module is how an operator
issues one key, to one named account, on purpose.

It does NOT create accounts. An address with no row is refused rather than
granted, because "create a user" and "set a password" are different decisions
and `app.grant_access` already owns the first one — with a `--role` it refuses
to default, precisely so that granting privilege is never a side effect of some
other command.

PRODUCTION-SAFE, like `app.grant_access` and `app.seed_kb`, and for the same
reason: production is exactly where it is needed. It writes one scrypt hash for
one address the operator names. That is the opposite of `app.seed`, which
refuses on ENV=prod because it creates SEVERAL accounts behind passwords
published in AGENTS.md — this tool cannot recreate those, because the password
comes from the prompt and never from the repository.

The account keeps Google sign-in. A password is an ADDITIONAL door for that
account, not a replacement: the `users` row is unchanged apart from its hash,
and `google_callback` still finds it. To take the password away again, run
`--revoke`, which restores the SSO-only sentinel.
