"""B1.2 — a grant says what you may do AND where.

Before this, `admin.students` granted to a faculty member in one college read
every student in the other, and the Governance screen showed one word — the
capability's label — with nothing to say how far it went.

The four things these tests hold down, in order of how quietly each would break:

1. THE EIGHTY EXISTING CALL SITES DO NOT CHANGE MEANING. `target` is opt-in; a
   three-argument call still asks "may you do this at all".
2. A ROLE BASELINE IS UNSCOPED. Scope is a property of a grant, because a grant
   is the thing somebody decided to hand over.
3. BOTH DEPARTMENT POINTERS ARE READ. A student reaches a department through
   their batch OR through `students.department_id`; reading one was a live bug
   in feature overrides before it was a hole here.
4. AN EMPTY REACH IS NOT AN UNRESTRICTED ONE. A grant scoped to a department
   that has since been deleted must see nothing, not everything.
