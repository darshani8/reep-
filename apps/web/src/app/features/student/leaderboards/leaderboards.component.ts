/**
 * Student leaderboards — the "Leaderboards" panel (mockup data-p="leaderboards").
 *
 * Five boards as a .tabs-row — Overall / Skills / VTU results / Streak / Mocks
 * taken — each rendering the .lb-row ranking visual — rank pill, initials
 * avatar, name, and the metric total, with the viewer's own row highlighted
 * (.me).
 *
 * Reworked for motivation + privacy (UX audit):
 *   - a prominent "You're Rank N of {cohort_size}" card for the viewer's own
 *     position, with encouraging framing for lower ranks (top X% / a nudge);
 *   - batch context ("of N") wherever a rank appears;
 *   - a per-board scoring + refresh explainer;
 *   - a "Hide me from leaderboards" control that drives
 *     PUT /student/leaderboard-visibility and reflects the opt-out state.
 *
 * Wired to GET /student/leaderboards?board=<key>, which ranks the caller's
 * batch and honours the leaderboard opt-out in both directions (an opted-out
 * student sees no ranks, and appears on none).
 *
 * ONLY A CLASSMATE WITH A RECORD ON A BOARD IS RANKED, AND EQUAL TOTALS SHARE A
 * RANK (2026-09-17). The server used to rank the whole roster at zero, so the
 * "not ranked here yet" card below was unreachable and "Rank 2 of 30" sat under
 * a student holding nothing. Rows are tracked by `student_id` because two rows
 * can now carry the same rank, and `cohort_size` is the number of students
 * ranked on this board — which the column header and the explainer now say.
 *
 * THE BOARD IS THE BATCH, AND THE BATCH IS ON THE SCREEN (2026-09-22). The
 * server says WHO the student is ranked against (`scope`: their batch, else the
 * department they named, else nobody) and the line under the title prints it,
 * because "your batch has no results yet" and "you are not seated in a batch"
 * look identical as an empty table and are fixed by different people. The
 * batch mates who hold nothing on a board yet are listed BELOW the ranking by
 * name — still not ranked, still no confident zero, but no longer invisible,
 * which is what a fresh batch used to be. And `overall` is the rank across the
 * four component boards, each worth up to 25 points scaled to the batch's
 * best; it is the tab the screen opens on.
