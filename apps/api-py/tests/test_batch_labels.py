"""A batch is a YEAR; its course and specialization are LINKS.

`app/batch_labels.py` is the one place the two are put back together for a
person to read, and this module pins that sentence — plus the fact that its
client twin, `apps/web/src/app/core/batch-label.ts`, says the same thing. Two
implementations of one rule drift the first time somebody changes a separator,
and the symptom is a picker where two batches read alike.

NO DATABASE. Every assertion here is pure, so this file runs on a machine with
no Postgres and fails fast in CI before the integration suite has connected.
