"""Last-line PII scrubbing for Sentry events, transactions, breadcrumbs and logs.

Rule 1 applied to telemetry. The three constructor flags in app/observability.py
cover frame locals, request bodies and cookies. NOTHING covers the query string,
and nothing covers a log record whose formatted message IS the secret. Those are
carried by mechanisms the SDK enables by default, so they must be removed by a
hook rather than by an option a future SDK release can rename underneath us.

Why a query string is the first carrier this file names: in sentry-sdk 2.68.1
the ASGI integration filters the query string ONLY when
`_experiments["data_collection"]` is set, so `GET /api/register/verify?token=`
(a live, single-use, account-provisioning token) and
`GET /api/auth/sso/google/callback?code=&state=` (a Google authorization code)
ship verbatim on error events AND on sampled transactions — request data is
attached by an event processor and those run for transactions too. A token does
not need an exception to leak; it needs a dice roll on a successful 302.

No sentry_sdk import: these are plain dict transforms, so the tests run with no
DSN, no network and no database, and the functions can be called on any payload.
Every public function is total — a malformed payload comes back unchanged rather
than raising, because a scrubber that raises inside the SDK's hook drops the
event, which is the safe direction but not a reason to be sloppy.
