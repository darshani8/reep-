"""What every interview engine shares, and what none of them owns alone.

`/api/interview` has had more than one engine behind it since the local one
landed, and the pieces below were never about any of them: the persona a student
is assessed against, the records the router's writers take, the close codes the
browser maps to sentences, the per-worker and per-user caps, and the defensive
parse that turns a model's JSON into a scorecard. They lived in
app/interview_relay.py because that was the only engine when they were written.

THEY OUTLIVED IT. The OpenAI relay is gone (2026-09) and Amazon Nova 2 Sonic
runs the interview; the local engine still runs it with nothing leaving the
machine. Neither inherits from the other, and both hold to the same contracts —
which is only true because the contracts live HERE, in one file, imported rather
than copied. A parallel definition of `_TurnRecord` would drift the moment
either side gained a field, silently: both would still construct, and only one
would carry the new value into the database.

RULE 1 (AGENTS.md) is why this module imports no ORM model, no Session and no
app.conversations, exactly as the relay did not. Everything an engine persists
leaves through a callable that routers/interview.py supplies, so the containment
is a property of the import graph rather than a convention — and that is what
lets the engines' tests drive the whole turn protocol with no database.

Nothing here knows a wire protocol. If something in this file starts describing
events, it belongs in the engine that speaks them.

# AGENTS.md rule 1 gates student PII leaving the machine, and Bedrock is
# emphatically not loopback. A fixed persona carries no marks, USN or attendance,
# and neither does a specialization key the student chose in the UI, so the
# hosted engine sits outside that gate today. The moment anyone personalises
# these instructions (branch, CGPA, target company) or feeds a resume into the
# session, the path must be routed through student_data_egress_allowed() in
# apps/api-py/app/ai/llm.py and degrade to this generic persona when it refuses --
# the same shape as /student/resume/generate falling back to used_ai=false.
#
