"""Interview Engine v3 §8.3 — the two consent gates on the socket.

The gates themselves are four lines each. They are tested because of what
sits behind them: a student's voice on a remote provider's wire, and a
transcript kept for 180 days that their mentor and the placement director can
read. "Was this student consented at the time of interview X" has to be
answerable from a row, and the only way that stays true is if the code that
refuses to open an interview without one is pinned by something that fails
loudly when somebody softens it.

The two gates fail in OPPOSITE directions, and that asymmetry is the thing most
likely to be "tidied" into consistency by a later editor:

  * `_open_records` fails CLOSED. An unreachable database refuses the interview,
    because "we could not check whether they agreed" and "they agreed" are not
    the same sentence.
  * `_make_heartbeat`'s revocation watch fails OPEN. A transient database error
    must not end a live call that a real grant authorised, so it stops the
    session only on a query that came back and said the row is gone.

Everything here is database-backed, because both gates are queries and a fake
would only pin the shape of the code that was written rather than the behaviour
the student is promised. Every test owns the rows it touches and tears them
down.
