"""Knowledge Base seed — the ONLY seed that is safe to run in production.

    python -m app.seed_kb

Split out of `app.seed` deliberately. That module creates demo accounts with
published passwords (director@bgscet.ac.in / director123 among them) and is now
refused outright when ENV=prod. But the KB is not demo data: it is the grounded
assistant's entire source of truth, and without it every "how do I verify a
skill?" falls back to ungrounded generation. Production needs this content and
must never need the accounts, so they no longer travel together.

Contains NO student facts and NO credentials — approved, student-audience
policy/FAQ/guidance only, the "explain the rules" layer. A student's own numbers
still come from the authenticated records view.

Idempotent: keyed on document title, so re-running adds nothing.
