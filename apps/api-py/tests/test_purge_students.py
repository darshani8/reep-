"""Deleting every STUDENT while the faculty stay exactly where they are.

`app.purge_people` is proven by one question — does the delete order satisfy 93
real foreign keys. This module has to answer that AND a second one that
`purge_people` never faces: for every table a student and a staff member can
BOTH hold rows in, did the right half go?

That is why `_seed_one_of_each` builds a faculty member and a student with the
SAME SHAPES of row — a leave request each, a login day each, a conversation and
a message each, an assistant run each — and the test asserts on both halves of
every pair. A test that only checked "the student is gone" would pass just as
happily against a module that emptied the tables outright, which is precisely
the bug this module exists to not have.

The delete runs against the REAL schema and is rolled back, for
`purge_people`'s reason: a synthetic fixture graph proves the order against the
constraints somebody remembered to reproduce.
