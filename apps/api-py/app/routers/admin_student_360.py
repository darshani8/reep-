"""B4.5 — one student, every panel the office opens their record for.

    GET /api/admin/students/{student_id}/360

WHAT IT REPLACES. `features/admin/student-detail` says so in its own docstring:
there is no `GET /api/admin/students/{id}`, so the screen fetches the WHOLE
roster and picks one row out of it, discarding the list in the same statement —
and then makes five more round trips for the panels beside it. This is that one
read. The identity block is deliberately the roster's own `AdminStudentOut`,
built by `admin_students._one`, so the card at the top of the detail screen and
the row in the grid behind it cannot disagree about a student's batch, faculty
or stage.

IT IS A READ AND IT WRITES NOTHING — no audit row of its own, for
`routers/audit.py`'s stated reason: opening a record is the most frequent action
the console performs, and a trail that logs every read buries the writes it
exists to show. Nothing here mutates a row, and nothing here calls a model, so
rule 1's egress gate is not on this path.

BOTH FENCES, SEPARATELY (AGENTS.md, "Phase 3 added a THIRD fence beside that
one"). This endpoint names a student in the path, which is the exact shape rule
2 governs, so:

  * `require_capability(db, session, "admin.students", target=ancestry_of_student(...))`
    asks may-you-at-all AND may-you-HERE — B1.2's question, the same pair
    `admin_students.update_student` asks before an edit; and
  * `_assert_can_access_student` asks rule 2's question, which is stricter on a
    MENTOR's own students and is never relaxed by a capability.

Neither replaces the other. A change that reaches one and not the other opens
the other — that is not hypothetical here, it is what the DIRECTOR removal did.

EVERY MISSING NUMBER IS NULL, NEVER 0. The rule has bitten REEP on three
screens (English baseline sections, capability growth, `_attendance_pct`): a
pending section rendered as a confident `0` tells a mentor a student failed
something nobody has looked at yet. So `results` is `null` for a semester with
no marks imported, `best_interview_score` is `null` when no interview was ever
scored, and — see `_semester_windows` — the per-semester ACTIVITY counts are
`null` rather than `0` whenever the dates that would attribute them to a
semester are not on record.

THE MENTOR-HISTORY PANEL IS FILLED NOW, and it kept its `available` flag. B9.1
landed `mentor_assignments`, so the panel reads the real spells — who, from
when, to when, who moved them and why. `available` stays on the shape rather
than being dropped because it still carries a fact the entries cannot: an EMPTY
list is "nothing was recorded", never "this student has never had a mentor", and
the two are different on a deployment whose oldest pairings predate the table.
The note says which of those it is in words, and the CURRENT assignment is still
reported separately as a present-tense fact, because a panel that shows only
today's faculty member with no dates reads as "this student has always had this
mentor", which is a claim this data cannot make.

    narrow the WHOLE trail for a scoped holder. This is not the whole trail —
    it is the rows whose `entity_id` is this student's record or this student's
    account, for a caller who has already been proven to reach that student by
    both fences above. The narrowing is by entity, which the row does carry, so
    the objection that made audit.py role-gated does not apply.

    A registration's approval — the row that minted this account — is filed
    under `entity_type='registration'` against the APPLICATION's id, which this
    student row does not point at. It is deliberately not chased through the
    email address: matching a person by the string they typed on a public form
    is how the wrong person's application ends up on somebody's record.
