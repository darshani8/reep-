"""The production boot guard: what this process REFUSES to start with.

`Settings.production_boot_failures()` (app/config.py) is the highest-severity
finding of the 2026-08 backend audit, made enforceable. A production host running
on the AUTH_SECRET committed to this repository is not a weak default to rotate
later: it is one forged `{"role":"DIRECTOR"}` cookie away from every student's
marks, attendance and USN — no login, no Google round trip, no database row
involved. app/main.py's lifespan asks the question and raises, so the process
never binds a port.

It shipped with no test, and that is a bad shape for a guard of this kind: it can
only fire on a host nobody runs the suite on. Nothing would have noticed it being
softened to a warning, re-keyed onto the wrong flag, or quietly returning [].

THE MOST IMPORTANT SECTION HERE IS THE LAST ONE. A boot guard that trips on a
laptop or in CI does not get fixed — it gets deleted by whoever is trying to ship
something else that afternoon. So "empty on every development ENV" is pinned as
hard as "non-empty in production", and the real `settings` singleton the suite
itself boots under is asserted directly.

NOTHING HERE MUTATES THE `settings` SINGLETON. Every case builds its own
`Settings(...)`, and the two lifespan tests rebind `app.main.settings` through
monkeypatch, which reverts at teardown. Mutating the shared object would leak
`env="prod"` into whatever module ran next — and the properties that read it
decide cookie `Secure`, password sign-in and voice-worker auth, which is three
other test modules' subject matter.

`_env_file=None` on every construction, so a developer's own apps/api-py/.env
cannot decide whether these pass. Without it, "a clean production config boots"
would quietly be testing whatever secret happens to be on this machine.

The private names are imported deliberately. The guard compares against these
exact constants, so the test must too: a copy pasted here would keep passing on
the day someone edits a default and leaves the guard testing a string nobody uses
any more — which is the failure config.py's own comment says the shared constants
exist to prevent.
