# Student: profile, jobs and tools

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Screens | `/student/profile`, `/student/uploads`, `/student/resume`, `/student/jobs`, `/student/english`, `/student/mentor-log`, `/student/interviews`, `/student/assistant`, `/student/agent`, and the floating assistant orb and dock on every student screen |
| Automated tests | [`tests/04-student-tools.spec.ts`](../../tests/04-student-tools.spec.ts) |
| ID range | TC-300 to TC-399 |

Setup, the seeded accounts and the rules that link these cases to their
automated tests are in [the index](../manual-test-cases.md).

Unless a case says otherwise, every case runs as the dev seed's student,
`student@bgscet.ac.in` (password `student123`, name Test Student, USN
`1BG24MBA001`). The automated tests sign that account in through the API
before step 1, so their step 1 starts on a signed-in browser. By hand, sign in
on `/login` first, with the Student portal selected.

## TC-300 — Profile shows the locked identity and institutional assignment

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-300 |
| Module | Student: profile |
| Priority | P1 |
| Type | Functional, positive |
| Automated test | `tests/04-student-tools.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-300` |

### Pre-conditions

1. The web app and the API are running as described in "Setup" in the index,
   with a development `ENV` and the dev seed applied.
2. You are signed in as the dev seed's student, and nothing else is signed in
   as that account. REEP keeps one live session per account.
3. The student is still seated in the seeded batch (`MBA-2026-B`) under the
   seeded college, department, course and specialization. The card is read
   through that batch, so moving the student on the admin roster changes what
   this case sees.
4. The student is still cleared for placements. Only the placement office can
   change that.

### Test data

| Field | Value on the seeded record |
|---|---|
| Full name | Test Student |
| USN | `1BG24MBA001` |
| College | BGS College of Engineering and Technology |
| Department | Department of Management Studies |
| Course | Master of Business Administration |
| Specialization | Finance |
| Batch | 2024-26 |
| Entry date | 2024-08-01 |
| Expected completion | 2026-07-31 |

### Steps

1. Open `/student/profile`.
2. Click in the USN field and type the letter X.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 1 | The "Profile" page opens. The "Identity" card, marked "Synced · read-only", shows Full name "Test Student" and USN "1BG24MBA001". |
| ER-2 | 1 | The "Institutional assignment" card, marked "Verified by Main Admin · read-only", shows each value in the test data under its label: College, Department, Course, Specialization, Batch, Entry date and Expected completion. Under them: "Locked — not editable by students. Your college, department and batch are set by the Main Admin; ask the office if any of it is wrong." |
| ER-3 | 1 | The "Placement preferences" card carries the chip "Cleared for placements". |
| ER-4 | 2 | The USN still reads "1BG24MBA001": typing changes nothing. Every field on the Identity and Institutional assignment cards is read-only. |

   GitHub and Portfolio empty; City "Bengaluru"; career summary "MBA finance
   candidate seeking placement."; "Interested in jobs" and "Interested in
   internships" ticked; "Hide me from the leaderboards" unticked. The
   percentages in ER-1 and ER-2 are counted from these. The automated test
   puts these values in place through the API before step 1, and afterwards
   restores whatever the profile held before it ran.

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Phone | `98765 43210` |

3. Replace the value in the City field with the test city.
4. Click Save changes.
5. Reload the page.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 1 | The "Placement profile completion" card reads "57% complete" and "4 of 7 placement fields filled. Add phone, contact email, LinkedIn to strengthen your placement profile." The status beside the button reads "Up to date", and Save changes is disabled. |

| ER-3 | 4 | The status reads "Saved just now", followed by the time of the save, and Save changes is disabled again. |
| ER-4 | 5 | The saved values came back from the server: Phone shows "98765 43210", City shows the test city, the status reads "Up to date" and the completion card still reads "71% complete". |

### Post-conditions

The profile keeps the new phone number and city. Put the seeded values back
by hand (Phone empty, City "Bengaluru", then Save changes). The automated test
restores the profile it found through the API.

## TC-309 — Filling a resume builder section and saving it

| Field | Value |

### Pre-conditions

1. The web app and the API are running as described in "Setup" in the index,
   with a development `ENV` and the dev seed applied.
2. You are signed in as the dev seed's student, and nothing else is signed in
   as that account.
3. The resume builder holds nothing yet, as on a fresh seed, so "Profile
   complete" reads 0%. Each of the 12 content sections counts for 1/12 of the
   percentage. The automated test empties the builder through the API before
   step 1 and restores what it held afterwards.

### Test data

| Field | Value |

3. Type the test objective in the Career objective box.
4. Click Save section.

| ER-2 | 2 | The section heading changes to "Other Details", with "Objective, key expertise, achievements, awards and activities." and a "Career objective" card. |
| ER-3 | 3 | The counter under the box shows the objective's length out of 6000, e.g. "56 / 6000", and the save chip reads "Unsaved changes". The builder autosaves about 1.5 seconds after the last keystroke, so a slow tester may see "Saved just now" already. |
| ER-4 | 4 | The save chip reads "Saved just now" and "Profile complete" reads 8% (one section of 12). |
| ER-5 | 5 | "Profile complete" still reads 8%, read back from the server. |
| ER-6 | 6 | The Career objective box holds the test objective. |

### Post-conditions

The builder keeps the objective, and the next generated resume opens with it
instead of the profile's career summary. Empty the box and save to undo it.
The automated test restores the builder it found through the API.

### Pre-conditions

1. The web app and the API are running as described in "Setup" in the index,
   with a development `ENV` and the dev seed applied.
2. You are signed in as the dev seed's student, and nothing else is signed in
   as that account.

   closing date.
4. One more open posting closes within the week. Create it as the Main Admin
   with "Post a job" on `/admin/jobs`, with the test data below and no
   college, course or track, so every student sees it. The automated test
   creates it through the same API as `admin@bgscet.ac.in`.

| ER-2 | 2 | Only BI Developer is listed. Financial Analyst, Junior Accountant and the test posting are hidden, and a Clear button appears. |
| ER-3 | 3 | No posting is both not eligible and in Mysuru, so the table reads "No roles match these filters." |
| ER-4 | 4 | Every posting is listed again, the filters read All, All locations and All, and the Clear button is gone. |
| ER-5 | 5 | Only postings closing within seven days are listed: the test posting is shown, and the three seeded postings, which have no deadline, are hidden. |

### Post-conditions

The test posting stays on the board. Delete it as the Main Admin on
`/admin/jobs` (nobody has applied to it). The automated test deletes it
through the API.

## TC-314 — Applying to an eligible posting

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-314 |
| Module | Student: jobs |
| Priority | P1 |
| Type | Functional, positive |
| Automated test | `tests/04-student-tools.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-314` |

### Pre-conditions

1. The web app and the API are running as described in "Setup" in the index,
   with a development `ENV` and the dev seed applied.
2. You are signed in as the dev seed's student, and nothing else is signed in
   as that account.
3. An open posting the student is eligible for and has not applied to, with
   an apply link. Create it as the Main Admin with "Post a job" on
   `/admin/jobs`, with the test data below and no college, course or track.
   The automated test creates it through the same API as
   `admin@bgscet.ac.in`.

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Title | `E2E apply <run id>` (any unique title) |
| Company | `E2E Co` |
| Level | PG |
| Location | `E2E Town` |
| Deadline | none |
| Apply link | `https://example.com/apply/<run id>` |

The form cannot name required skills (it only carries them over from a
duplicated posting), and a posting that names none is a 100% match for every
student.

The automated run answers the apply link inside the browser with a small
local page, so it does not depend on example.com being reachable.

### Steps

1. Open `/student/jobs`.
2. Click Apply on the test posting's row.
3. Reload the page.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 1 | The test posting's row reads "Eligible", a 100% skill match and "Not applied", with an Apply button. |
| ER-2 | 2 | The posting's apply link opens in a new tab. The row's status changes to "Applied", and its button reads "Applied" and is disabled. |
| ER-3 | 3 | The row still reads "Applied": the application was recorded on the server. |

### Post-conditions

The application stays on the student's record: a student cannot withdraw it,
and the posting can no longer be deleted. Close the posting as the Main Admin
on `/admin/jobs` to take it off the board. The automated test closes it
through the API.

## TC-315 — The English baseline shows pending sections as dashes, not zeros

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-315 |
| Module | Student: English baseline |
| Priority | P1 |
| Type | Functional, positive |
| Automated test | `tests/04-student-tools.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-315` |

### Pre-conditions

1. The web app and the API are running as described in "Setup" in the index,
   with a development `ENV` and the dev seed applied.
2. You are signed in as the dev seed's student, and nothing else is signed in
   as that account.
3. The student's latest English baseline attempt is the seeded one, for
   semester 2: Reading, Writing and Listening scored, Speaking pending. Only
   the assessment pipeline scores a section, so nothing on screen changes it.

### Test data

| Section | Score | CEFR |
|---|---|---|
| Reading | 68 | B2 |
| Writing | 57 | B1 |
| Listening | 61 | B1 |
| Speaking | pending | — |
| Overall | 62 | B1+ (provisional) |

### Steps

1. Open `/student/english`.
2. Click View AI report on the Reading card.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 1 | The "English Proficiency Baseline" page shows the overall score "62" "/ 100" under "Provisional band" "B1+" "Independent user", with the chips "3 of 4 sections scored" and "Speaking pending · 12 min", "Assessment progress" at 75%, and "Your band is provisional until the speaking section is submitted." |
| ER-2 | 1 | The Reading, Writing and Listening cards are marked "Scored" and show 68, 57 and 61 with CEFR B2, B1 and B1. Listening reads "No written report for this section." |
| ER-3 | 1 | The Speaking card is marked "Pending" and shows "--" where the score goes, never 0, with "CEFR —". Its Fluency, Pronunciation and Interaction bars also read "--", and it offers "Start speaking test". |
| ER-4 | 2 | The Reading card shows the assessor's note "Reads at pace and handles detail well; inference under time pressure is the next lift." and its button now reads "Hide AI report". |

## TC-316 — The English baseline allows one attempt per semester

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-316 |
| Module | Student: English baseline |
| Priority | P1 |
| Type | Functional, negative |
| Automated test | `tests/04-student-tools.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-316` |

### Pre-conditions

1. The web app and the API are running as described in "Setup" in the index,
   with a development `ENV` and the dev seed applied.
2. You are signed in as the dev seed's student, and nothing else is signed in
   as that account.
3. The student's current semester is 2, and the seeded semester-2 attempt of
   TC-315 exists.

### Test data

None beyond the seeded attempt.

### Steps

1. Open `/student/english`.
2. Click Resume assessment.
3. Reload the page.
4. Click Start speaking test on the Speaking card.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 1 | The main button reads "Resume assessment", not "Start assessment", because this semester's attempt already exists. |
| ER-2 | 2 | The page says "Resuming the attempt already open for this semester." and still shows the same attempt: "62", "3 of 4 sections scored". No second, blank attempt is opened. |
| ER-3 | 4 | The same message appears again and the attempt is unchanged: starting a single section also reopens this semester's one attempt. |

## TC-317 — Downloading the English baseline report

| Field | Value |
|---|---|

| Module | Student: English baseline |
| Priority | P2 |
| Type | Functional, positive |

### Pre-conditions

1. The web app and the API are running as described in "Setup" in the index,
   with a development `ENV` and the dev seed applied.
2. You are signed in as the dev seed's student, and nothing else is signed in
   as that account.
3. The seeded attempt of TC-315 exists.

### Test data

None.

### Steps

1. Open `/student/english`.
2. Click Download report.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 2 | The browser saves a PDF file named `english-baseline.pdf`. |
| ER-2 | 2 | **Manual only.** The PDF is headed "English Proficiency Baseline", then "Test Student · 1BG24MBA001 · Taken <date>". It reads "Provisional band: B1+ · Independent user", "Overall: 62 / 100" and "3 of 4 sections scored — Speaking pending · 12 min". In its Sections table, Speaking reads "Not yet taken", "—" and "Pending assessment", never 0. |

---

## TC-318 — Starting the English baseline for the first time

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-318 |
| Module | Student: English baseline |
| Priority | P2 |
| Type | Functional, positive and negative |
| Automated test | None (manual only): it needs a student with no attempt for their current semester. The dev seed's only student already has one, and nothing in the product deletes an attempt, so an automated run could pass once per database and never again. |

### Pre-conditions

1. The web app and the API are running as described in "Setup" in the index,
   with a development `ENV`.
2. You are signed in as a student who has never opened an English baseline
   attempt, for example one approved through the registration flow of module
   02. Nothing else is signed in as that account.

### Test data

None.

### Steps

1. Open `/student/english`.
2. In the same browser, open `/api/student/english-baseline/report`.
3. Go back to `/student/english` and click Start assessment.
4. Click Resume assessment.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 1 | The page reads "You have not taken the baseline yet." and "It takes about 70 minutes across four sections and places you on the CEFR scale. Your mentor sees the band, not your answers." with Start assessment buttons. There is no Download report button. |
| ER-2 | 2 | The API answers 404 with `{"detail":"You have not taken the English baseline yet."}`. No report exists before an attempt. |
| ER-3 | 3 | The page says "Assessment opened. Your sections are listed below — take them in any order." The attempt shows "--" "/ 100", band "—" and "Not yet banded", "0 of 4 sections scored" and "Reading pending". All four cards are "Pending" with "--". The main button now reads "Resume assessment", and Download report appears. |
| ER-4 | 4 | The page says "Resuming the attempt already open for this semester." A second attempt is never created in the same semester. |

### Post-conditions

The student has an attempt for this semester, so this case cannot be run
again with the same account.

## TC-319 — The Faculty / TPO Log shows the meeting history and SWOC

| Field | Value |

### Pre-conditions

1. The web app and the API are running as described in "Setup" in the index,
   with a development `ENV` and the dev seed applied.
2. You are signed in as the dev seed's student, and nothing else is signed in
   as that account.
3. The seeded mentor note and the four seeded SWOC lines are still on the
   student's record.

### Test data

| Quadrant | Line | Written by |
|---|---|---|
| Strength | Strong analytical and quantitative skills. | Test Mentor · Your mentor |
| Weakness | Needs structured problem-solving practice. | Main Admin (seed) · Placement cell |
| Opportunity | Fintech internships opening this quarter. | Main Admin (seed) · Programme |
| Challenge | Public speaking under time pressure. | Test Mentor · Your mentor |

The seeded meeting: "1:1 review" at Cabin 3, action "1:1 scheduled", note
"Discussed placement readiness; strong on analytics, work on GD delivery.",
logged by Test Mentor.

### Steps

1. Open `/student/mentor-log`.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 1 | The "Faculty / TPO Log" page opens with a Request a meeting button. |
| ER-2 | 1 | The card "SWOC — Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Challenges" shows each line of the test data in its quadrant, with its author, its source and the date it was written. |
| ER-3 | 1 | "Meeting history" lists the seeded meeting: "1:1 review · Cabin 3", the chip "1:1 scheduled", its note, and "Logged by Test Mentor". |

## TC-320 — Requesting a meeting with the mentor

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-320 |
| Module | Student: mentor log |
| Priority | P1 |
| Type | Functional, positive |
| Automated test | `tests/04-student-tools.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-320` |

### Pre-conditions

1. The web app and the API are running as described in "Setup" in the index,
   with a development `ENV` and the dev seed applied.
2. You are signed in as the dev seed's student, and nothing else is signed in
   as that account.
3. The student's mentor is still Test Mentor (`mentor@bgscet.ac.in`), as
   seeded.

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| What would you like to discuss? | Any unique text, e.g. `GD delivery before the mock next month`. The automated run uses `E2E meeting <run id>`. |
| Preferred time (optional) | `Thursday afternoon` |

### Steps

1. Open `/student/mentor-log`.
2. Click Request a meeting.
3. Type the test reason in the "What would you like to discuss?" box.
4. Type Thursday afternoon in the "Preferred time (optional)" box.
5. Click Send request.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 2 | A "Request a meeting" form opens with "This goes to your mentor and appears in the log below, so you both have the same record of what was asked." The Send request button is disabled while the reason is empty, and the Request a meeting button is disabled while the form is open. |
| ER-2 | 3 | Send request becomes enabled. |
| ER-3 | 5 | The form closes and the page says "Sent to Test Mentor. It appears in your meeting log below." The top of "Meeting history" shows "Meeting requested" with the chip "Note only", the note "Meeting requested by the student. <reason> Preferred time: Thursday afternoon.", and "Logged by Test Mentor". |
| ER-4 | 5 | The mentor receives it: signed in as `mentor@bgscet.ac.in`, the student's notes on the Mentee Log include the same note. |

### Post-conditions

The request stays as a note in the student's log and the mentor's notes. The
mentor can remove it from the Mentee Log. The automated test removes it
through the API as the mentor.

## TC-321 — A student with no mentor cannot request a meeting

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-321 |
| Module | Student: mentor log |
| Priority | P3 |
| Type | Functional, negative |
| Automated test | None (manual only): it needs a student with no mentor. The dev seed's only student has one, and releasing that mentor to set this up writes the student's mentor history and gives the mentor a 90-day read-only handover grant, which the product never removes. |

### Pre-conditions

1. The web app and the API are running as described in "Setup" in the index,
   with a development `ENV`.
2. You are signed in as a student with no faculty member assigned, and
   nothing else is signed in as that account. The Main Admin releases a
   student on the Assign faculty screen (`/admin/mentors`).

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| What would you like to discuss? | Any text |

### Steps

1. Open `/student/mentor-log`.
2. Click Request a meeting.
3. Type the test reason in the "What would you like to discuss?" box.
4. Click Send request.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 4 | The page says "You do not have a mentor assigned yet, so there is nobody to send this to. The placement office assigns mentors." The form stays open with the text still in it, and nothing is added to "Meeting history". |

## TC-322 — The Mock interviews screen before any interview

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-322 |
| Module | Student: mock interview records |
| Priority | P2 |
| Type | Functional, positive |
| Automated test | `tests/04-student-tools.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-322` |

### Pre-conditions

1. The web app and the API are running as described in "Setup" in the index,
   with a development `ENV` and the dev seed applied.
2. You are signed in as the dev seed's student, and nothing else is signed in
   as that account.
3. The student has never started a mock interview, as on a fresh seed. Any
   interview started on `/student/assistant`, even one that failed to
   connect (TC-327), leaves a record here, and so do module 08's interview
   record cases. The automated test is Skipped when one exists: that is used-up
   test data, not a broken environment. The full suite runs this module before
   module 08, so a fresh database always reaches this case.

### Test data

None.

### Steps

1. Open `/student/interviews`.
2. Click Take your first interview.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 1 | The "Mock interviews" page opens with "These are kept on the college's server as part of your interview record. Your mentor and the placement office can read them. Clearing your conversation on the interview screen does not delete them — ask the placement cell if you need one removed." |
| ER-2 | 1 | Instead of a table, a card reads "No mock interviews yet" and "The AI interviewer asks one question at a time, out loud, and writes you a practice report at the end. Nothing here is graded and nothing counts towards placement." |
| ER-3 | 2 | The browser goes to `/student/assistant`, the "Mock interview" page. |

## TC-323 — Reading a past interview's transcript and report

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-323 |
| Module | Student: mock interview records |
| Priority | P2 |
| Type | Functional, positive |
| Automated test | None (manual only): a record with turns and a report exists only after a real voice interview with Amazon Nova 2 Sonic on AWS Bedrock (TC-326), which needs AWS credentials and a microphone that the local test run does not have. |

### Pre-conditions

1. The web app and the API are running, with an interview engine that can
   reach its model, as in TC-326.
2. You are signed in as a student who has finished at least one mock
   interview, for example in TC-326.

### Test data

The interview held in TC-326.

### Steps

1. Open `/student/interviews`.
2. Click Open on the interview's row.
3. Click Close on the same row.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 1 | **Manual only.** The tiles "Interviews taken", "Completed to the end" and "Reports written" count the student's interviews. The table has the columns Date, Track, Status, Answers, Length and Report, and the interview is listed with its track in words (e.g. "Financial Analytics"), a status such as "Completed" or "Ended early", and its report status. |
| ER-2 | 2 | **Manual only.** Under the table, the interview opens: its track as a heading, its date, time and length, and "reached <stage>". It states whether a recording was kept, and with recording off: "No recording of your voice was kept for this interview — the transcript below is the whole of what was saved." Below come the practice report card (or "No report for this interview" with the reason) and the "Transcript", with each line marked You or Interviewer under its stage. |
| ER-3 | 3 | **Manual only.** The detail closes and the row's button reads Open again. |

## TC-324 — The mock interview page and its round picker

| Module | Student: mock interview |
| Priority | P2 |
| Type | Functional, positive |
| Automated test | `tests/04-student-tools.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-324` |

### Pre-conditions

1. The web app and the API are running as described in "Setup" in the index,
   with a development `ENV` and the dev seed applied.
2. You are signed in as the dev seed's student, and nothing else is signed in
   as that account.
3. The student's batch implies no interview track. The seeded specialization
   is Finance with the code `FIN`, and no track has that code (Financial
   Analytics is `fa`), so no round is preselected and General is selected.
   On a batch whose code matches a track, that track is preselected instead.

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Round | Finance |

### Steps

1. Open `/student/assistant`.
2. In the round picker, click Finance.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 1 | The "Mock interview" page opens with the note "The interviewer hears your voice and nothing else — it cannot see your marks, attendance or USN." The interview stage reads "Not connected" and "Pick a round, then press Start when you are ready.", lists the stages Opening, Probing, Deep dive and Wrap-up, and offers a Start interview button. |
| ER-2 | 1 | The round picker offers General, HR, Marketing, Analytics and Finance, with General selected. The briefing reads "Campus panel interviewer", "General placement round · Tier-1 MNC campus bar" and "Placement readiness across the board — no single track, and no scored report." |
| ER-3 | 2 | Finance is selected instead of General. The briefing changes to "Managing Director, Finance", "Finance & valuation round · Tier-1 MNC campus bar" and "DCF modelling, financial ratios, risk, valuation, M&A." Nothing starts: the stage still reads "Not connected". |

## TC-325 — Start shows the college's interview terms, and Cancel records nothing

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-325 |
| Module | Student: mock interview |
| Priority | P1 |
| Type | Functional, positive |
| Automated test | `tests/04-student-tools.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-325` |

### Pre-conditions

1. The web app and the API are running as described in "Setup" in the index,
   with a development `ENV` and the dev seed applied.
2. You are signed in as the dev seed's student, and nothing else is signed in
   as that account.
3. The student has never agreed to the interview terms, as on a fresh seed.
   Agreeing (TC-326, TC-327) records a consent the student cannot withdraw,
   and after that Start goes straight to the interview. Module 08's interview
   record cases agree on the student's behalf too. The automated test is
   Skipped when a consent exists, for the reason given in TC-322.
4. The student's college has no interview policy of its own, so the default
   applies: transcripts kept for 180 days, no recording, 8 interviews a day,
   8 minutes each. The automated test is Blocked otherwise.
5. The API's interview engine is the default, Amazon Nova 2 Sonic
   (`INTERVIEW_ENGINE` blank or `nova`).

### Test data

None.

### Steps

1. Open `/student/assistant`.
2. Click Start interview.
3. Click Cancel.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 2 | A "Before you start" dialog opens, before the microphone is asked for. Section 1, "The interviewer hears you live", says the microphone audio is streamed to "Amazon's Nova Sonic model, running on AWS Bedrock" and that nothing from the student record is sent with it. |
| ER-2 | 2 | Sections 2 to 4 state the college's policy: a transcript is kept and "It is deleted automatically after 180 days."; "Your college does not record these interviews."; and "You have N of 8 practice interviews used in the last 24 hours, and each one runs for up to 8 minutes.", where N is the number of interviews completed in the last 24 hours (0 on a fresh seed). The buttons are Cancel and "I agree — start the interview". |
| ER-3 | 3 | The dialog closes, the stage still reads "Not connected", and no "Terms accepted" line appears under Start interview: cancelling records no consent. |

## TC-326 — Holding a real mock interview

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-326 |
| Module | Student: mock interview |
| Priority | P1 |
| Type | Functional, positive |
| Automated test | None (manual only): the interview is a live speech-to-speech call to Amazon Nova 2 Sonic on AWS Bedrock. It needs AWS credentials allowed to call the model, and a microphone and a person to answer out loud, none of which the local test run has. |

### Pre-conditions

1. The web app and the API are running with the interview engine able to
   reach its model: `INTERVIEW_ENGINE` blank or `nova`, a region set
   (`NOVA_SONIC_REGION`, `BEDROCK_REGION` or `AWS_REGION`), and AWS
   credentials allowed `bedrock:InvokeModelWithBidirectionalStream` on
   `amazon.nova-2-sonic-v1:0`.
2. The browser has a working microphone and speakers, and the page is served
   over HTTPS or from localhost.
3. You are signed in as a student who has completed fewer than 8 interviews in
   the last 24 hours, and nothing else is signed in as that account.

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Round | Finance |

### Steps

1. Open `/student/assistant`.
2. In the round picker, click Finance.
3. Click Start interview.
4. If the "Before you start" dialog opens, click "I agree — start the interview".
5. Allow the browser to use the microphone.
6. Answer the interviewer's questions out loud until it gives its verdict, or click End interview.
7. Open `/student/interviews`.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 4 | **Manual only.** The dialog closes. Under Start interview a line reads "Terms accepted <date> · recording off" with a "Read again" button. |
| ER-2 | 5 | **Manual only.** The stage moves from "Connecting…" to "Connected" and "Listening", a clock counts up to the limit (e.g. "/ 08:00"), and the interviewer speaks first. The floating orb shows "Live" and the clock. |
| ER-3 | 6 | **Manual only.** The transcript lists the Interviewer's and your lines as they are spoken, and the stages light up in order. After the verdict, a practice report card appears with "Saved to your past interviews with the full transcript." |
| ER-4 | 7 | **Manual only.** The interview is listed, with Track "Financial Analytics" and a status of "Completed" or "Ended early". |

### Post-conditions

The student holds a consent under the current terms, so TC-325's
pre-condition no longer holds for them. The interview record is kept for 180
days.

## TC-327 — Starting an interview when the speech model cannot be reached

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-327 |
| Module | Student: mock interview |
| Priority | P2 |
| Type | Functional, negative |
| Automated test | None (manual only): it needs a microphone, which the automated browser does not have, and every attempt permanently adds a consent and a Failed interview record that nothing in the product removes, so a second automated run would meet a different screen. |

### Pre-conditions

1. The web app and the API are running as described in "Setup" in the index,
   with a development `ENV` and the dev seed applied, and the interview
   engine cannot reach its model. On the local stack the engine is Nova with
   a region set, so `GET /api/interview/status` answers `"available": true`,
   but Bedrock refuses the stream.
2. The browser has a microphone, and the page is served from localhost.
3. You are signed in as the dev seed's student, and nothing else is signed in
   as that account.

### Test data

None.

### Steps

1. Open `/student/assistant`.
2. Click Start interview.
3. If the "Before you start" dialog opens, click "I agree — start the interview".
4. Allow the browser to use the microphone.
5. Open `/student/interviews`.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 4 | **Manual only.** The stage reads "Preparing the interviewer…" for a few seconds, then "Problem", with the message "The interview service is temporarily unavailable. Please try again shortly." and a Dismiss button. The microphone is released. |
| ER-2 | 5 | **Manual only.** The attempt is listed with the status "Failed" and no report. It counts towards the 20 attempts a day, but not towards the 8 completed interviews. |

### Post-conditions

The student holds a consent and a Failed interview record, so the
pre-conditions of TC-322 and TC-325 no longer hold for them.

### Pre-conditions

1. The web app and the API are running as described in "Setup" in the index,
   with a development `ENV` and the dev seed applied, so the Knowledge Base
   holds the approved guidance documents.
2. The API has no language model configured, so answers are composed from
   the Knowledge Base and the student's records without a model, and are the
   same on every run.
3. You are signed in as the dev seed's student, and nothing else is signed in
   as that account.
4. The student's REEP Agent conversation is empty. If it is not, click Clear
   conversation first. The automated test clears it through the API.
5. The student has asked for fewer than 5 REEP Agent answers or generated
   resumes in the last minute.

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Question | "How do I verify a skill?" (one of the four suggested questions) |

### Steps

1. Open `/student/agent`.
2. Click the suggested question How do I verify a skill?
3. Click the thumbs-up (Helpful) button under the answer.
4. Click Clear conversation.
5. Reload the page.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 1 | The "REEP Agent" page opens with "The REEP Agent is a general helper — it does not see your private records, marks or attendance." and an empty conversation: "How can I help today?" with the suggested questions "What should I complete this week?", "Am I placement-ready?", "Show jobs I qualify for" and "How do I verify a skill?". Clear conversation is disabled. |
| ER-2 | 2 | The question appears as your message, followed by the agent's answer. As the first reply in the conversation it opens with the greeting "Jai Shri Gurudev!", then explains: "To get a skill like Power BI verified, upload a certificate or proof of completion as evidence and raise a skill claim with the level you are claiming." Under it is the source chip "Source: Verifying a skill (e.g. Power BI)", with Copy, Helpful, Not helpful and Report controls. |
| ER-3 | 3 | Helpful is shown as pressed and "Thanks for the feedback" appears. The server accepted the rating, so the button stays pressed. |
| ER-4 | 4 | The conversation empties back to "How can I help today?", and Clear conversation is disabled again. |
| ER-5 | 5 | The conversation is still empty after the reload: it was cleared on the server. |

### Post-conditions

The rating stays recorded against the answer, for the office's assistant
metrics. The cleared conversation is kept on the server, marked deleted, and
is no longer shown.

| ER-1 | 2 | The "REEP assistant" dock opens on the "Ask REEP" tab, beside a "Mock interview" tab. Its foot reads "Does not see your marks, attendance or USN — for those, open your records.", and its "Open as a page" link leads to `/student/agent`. |

| ER-3 | 4 | The Mock interview tab is selected and shows the interview room, with its round picker and a Start interview button. "Open as a page" now leads to `/student/assistant`. |
| ER-4 | 5 | The dock closes, and the round button's label reads "Open the REEP assistant" again. |

### Post-conditions
