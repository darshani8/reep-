/**
 * Every nav destination in the shell needs a route, or clicking it goes nowhere
 * and navigation reads as broken. Every route here is a built screen from the
 * design (docs/design-v4/reep-app-standalone.html); there are no placeholders
 * left to fill.
 *
 * ROUTES ARE LAZY (`loadComponent`, not `component`). A static `import` at the
 * top of this file pulls the component into the initial bundle no matter which
 * route the user visits — which is how every screen in the app ended up in one
 * 1.23 MB `main` chunk with no lazy chunks at all. A student on a phone was
 * downloading the mentor and admin UIs, plus the resume builder and the
 * assistant, before the login form could paint.
 *
 * Only the two things needed to render the first frame stay eager: the shell
 * (every authenticated route lives inside it) and the guard. Adding a screen
 * here means adding a `loadComponent` — a plain `component:` reference silently
 * un-splits the bundle again and only shows up as a budget failure later.
