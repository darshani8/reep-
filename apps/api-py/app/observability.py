"""One Sentry initialisation for every REEP process, and the policy around it.

Three processes report to Sentry, each to its own project, each through THIS
function and no other:

    reep-api                 app/main.py           SENTRY_DSN
    reep-scheduled-jobs      app/retention_job.py  SENTRY_JOBS_DSN
    reep-interview-worker    app/voice_platform/queue/worker.py
                                                   SENTRY_INTERVIEW_WORKER_DSN

A process names its service once, at import or at the top of main(), and the
DSN it hands over is the one for that project. A blank DSN is OFF: nothing is
initialised, every sentry_sdk call downstream is a documented no-op, and the
process says so in one log line. Nothing here falls back to another service's
DSN — the retention job runs on the api's task definition and could read
SENTRY_DSN, and must not, because a nightly sweep filed under the api's project
is a job nobody watches.

Three constructor flags are rule 1 applied to telemetry and are pinned by
tests/test_codebase_guards.py, which reads THIS file as text: send_default_pii,
include_local_variables and max_request_body_size. The hooks below are the
layer that still holds if a flag is ever dropped; app/telemetry_scrub.py owns
them and is tested without a DSN.

What is deliberately NOT here: any student text, in any span, tag or message —
`tests/test_tracing.py` pins that for the helpers in app/tracing.py, and the
scrubbers here are the backstop for the path nobody has written yet.
