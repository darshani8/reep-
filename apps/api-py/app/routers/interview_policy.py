"""The college's interview policy — the office's CRUD, the student's card, and
the cap reset (B6.1, B6.4).

Three surfaces, one table:

  PUT  /api/admin/interview-policies/{college_id}                 the default
  PUT  /api/admin/interview-policies/{college_id}/{course_id}     one course
  GET  /api/admin/interview-policies/{college_id}                 both, to edit
  POST /api/admin/students/{student_id}/interview-cap/reset       B6.4
  GET  /api/interview/policy                                      the student

WHY A MODULE OF ITS OWN. `09-coding-standards.md` names this file: one concept,
its service functions beside it (`app/interview_policy.py`) and nothing else.
The alternative was three more endpoints in `app/routers/admin.py`, which is
already the file every admin change touches — and the student card does not
belong there at all.

THE CAPABILITY IS `admin.interviews`, AND THIS MODULE IS WHY IT EXISTS. The key
was in 04-backend-changes.md's college-admin set for months while nothing
defined it; `app/routers/admin.py` carried a note saying 4c must add it to the
catalogue, to `COLLEGE_ADMIN_CAPABILITIES` and to a real `require_capability`
call IN ONE COMMIT, because a name in that tuple with no catalogue entry is a
KeyError thrown in front of whoever is appointing a college admin. The three
calls below are the third of those three.

IT CARRIES PII, so a GRANT of it lands `pending_approval` and holds nothing
until a second `admin.governance` holder approves it (B2.4). The Main Admin
holds it by baseline and is unaffected; a college admin on a one-admin
deployment will find these endpoints 403 until a deputy exists, which is the
honest consequence the Colleges screen already reports as "N awaiting approval".

THE SCOPE FENCE IS THE REACH, and it is the same shape `console.set_criteria`
uses: a college-scoped holder writes their OWN college's policy and not
another's, and the course is checked through ITS OWN college rather than by
taking the caller's word that it is theirs. The cap reset names a STUDENT in the
path, so it passes `ancestry_of_student` as the `target` — "may you do this at
all" and "may you do it HERE" are different questions and B1.2 answers the
second one only when it is asked.

RULE 1 is not in play (nothing here reaches a model). RULE 2 is: the cap reset
is a write ABOUT one student, so it goes through `_assert_can_access_student`
as well as the capability — the two fences are checked separately and on
purpose, and a capability can never relax the student filter.

    acknowledgement finding fewer scopes than the one it supersedes — see
