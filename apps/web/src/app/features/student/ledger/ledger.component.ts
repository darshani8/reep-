/**
 * The Time Allocation Ledger — six slots covering a 24-hour day, five activity
 * heads, hours to the nearest half.
 *
 * THE SERVER OWNS THE ARITHMETIC. The metrics strip, the day band's proportions,
 * the per-slot mix bars, the legend totals and the submit gate all arrive
 * computed from `GET /api/student/ledger`; this component types figures into
 * cells, PUTs them, and renders what comes back. Deriving any of it a second
 * time in TypeScript is how a band ends up disagreeing with the number printed
 * above it — see the note at the top of app/routers/student_programme.py.
 *
 * THE SERVER OWNS THE CALENDAR TOO (2026-09-22). "Today" is the `today` every
 * response carries — the programme's day, in the college's zone — and the
 * first load asks for no day at all so the server picks it. The stepper moves
 * through `shiftIsoDay`, which never touches local time: the old
 * `new Date(...T00:00:00)` / `toISOString()` pair parsed local midnight and
 * printed UTC, so in India "Previous day" went back two days and "Next day"
 * did not move. That is how a student who had filled Monday in came to report
 * that their record had vanished — see ledger-days.ts.
 *
 * A DAY LOCKS. `editable` / `locked` / `lock_reason` come from the server, the
 * inputs enable off `editable` alone, and the strip of recent days
 * (`GET /api/student/ledger/history`) is the record of what was filled in:
 * submitted, draft, not logged, locked — the screen showed one day at a time
 * and nothing else, so a fortnight of entries had nowhere to be seen.
 *
 * ONLY THE LAST DAY ASKED FOR IS DRAWN. Each step or chip loads its day, and
 * the answers can arrive in any order. The screen used to draw whichever
 * arrived LAST, so a quick second click while the first day was still loading
 * could settle on the earlier day, date control and all. Every read and write
 * carries `loadSeq` at the moment it was asked, and an answer whose number is
 * no longer current is dropped.
 *
 * EDITS ARE LOCAL UNTIL SAVED. `draft` holds what the student has typed; the
 * server's view is only replaced on a successful write. Re-rendering the whole
 * table from a response on every keystroke would move focus out of the cell
 * being typed in, and a PUT per keystroke would make the slot-capacity rule —
 * which is a property of the whole day — fire on half-typed numbers.
