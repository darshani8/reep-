"""The staff side of the v2 student screens.

    GET /api/mentor/students/{student_id}/ledger?day=      one day of the ledger
    GET /api/mentor/students/{student_id}/ledger/summary   the last N days
    GET /api/mentor/students/{student_id}/english-baseline the CEFR attempt

RULE 2 IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS MODULE. `app/routers/student_screens.py` is
first-person by construction — it reads `studentId` off the session and has no
path parameter naming a student anywhere, so there is nothing for a crafted id
to reach. These endpoints DO name a student in the path, which makes them the
exact shape rule 2 exists to govern, and every one of them goes through
`_assert_can_access_student` before it touches a row: a MENTOR sees only students
in their own group, a MENTOR with no group sees NOBODY, and DIRECTOR/ADMIN see
all. That helper lives in `routers/mentor.py` and is imported rather than
reimplemented — a second copy of a scope check is a second place for it to be
subtly wrong.

THE VIEWS ARE THE STUDENT'S OWN, not a staff rendering of the same rows. Both
endpoints call the builders in `student_screens.py`, so the metrics strip a
mentor reads is the one the student is looking at, computed by the same
expression. The alternative — a staff-shaped copy of "is this section pending or
scored", "how many hours short is this day" — is how a mentor ends up seeing a
confident 0 where the student sees a dash, and acting on it.

READ ONLY. There is deliberately no staff write path here: a mentor does not
edit a student's ledger. Their instrument is the meeting note, which already has
one.
