"""The cohort leaderboards -- `GET /api/student/leaderboards?board=` -- and the
two reasons they ranked nobody (2026-09-17).

A student had finished a mock interview, had their skills verified on
Skilling, and had classmates on the roster; the board still read as if no
ranking had been done. Two defects, pinned here:

  * the Skills board counted `student_skills`, a table the Skilling screen's
    verification never writes (a mentor's APPROVE mints an EARNED
    `student_badges` row), and counted its rows verified or not -- so
    "0 skills" against everybody on a live deployment;
  * every board ranked every classmate, at zero, in database order, so the
    ranks under the zeros were arbitrary and changed between cache refreshes,
    and "CGPA 0.00" was drawn against students whose results were never
    recorded.

A student with nothing recorded on a board is not on it now, equal totals
share a rank, and the Skills board counts what the mentor verified. Every
test here hits the seeded dev database like the rest of the suite, so a
cohort is minted per test and the students are `make_user` accounts seated
in it.

THE BOARD IS THE BATCH (2026-09-22). The second half of this module pins the
scope: a batch never sees another batch, the batch mates who hold nothing yet
are listed by name under the ranking rather than left out of the screen, a
student seated in no batch is ranked within the department they named and told
so, a student seated nowhere is told that instead of shown an empty board, and
the `overall` board adds the four single-component boards scaled to the best
in the batch.
