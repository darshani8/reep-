/**
 * The faculty directory grid: its columns, its cell renderers, its selection.
 *
 * AG Grid builds cell contents itself, outside Angular's template compiler, so
 * a component-scoped class never reaches them. Every renderer below uses GLOBAL
 * classes (`.chip`, `.avatar`, `.btn`, `.icon` in styles/reep-v2.scss) and
 * inline styles, exactly as the roster grid on Students & batches does — and
 * escapes every value it interpolates.
 *
 * STATUS IS REAL NOW; SIGN-IN IS STILL EMPTY, AND THEY ARE EMPTY FOR DIFFERENT
 * REASONS. B3.3 landed `users.disabled_at`, and `GET /api/admin/faculty`
 * carries it, so Status reads the account itself: a `.chip good` "Active" or a
 * `.chip risk` "Disabled" with the day it happened — text AND colour, never
 * colour alone. The board's third state, "Invited", is NOT drawn: nothing in
 * that payload says whether an account has ever redeemed its activation link,
 * and guessing it from a blank field would be exactly the plausible-looking
 * cell this file exists to refuse.
 *
 * Sign-in stays an em dash. Login events ARE recorded (B15), but the only
 * endpoint that reads them serves the SIGNED-IN account its own history on My
 * account; no admin endpoint answers "when did somebody else last sign in", so
 * there is nothing here to draw. The header tooltip says that, and the screen
 * repeats it once in a `.notice.accent`.
 *
 * FUNCTIONS IS HALF ANSWERABLE AND SHOWS EXACTLY THAT HALF. The mentor function
 * is real today — it is the `Mentor` group the office creates by assigning the
 * first student — so a held group renders as the board's "Mentor · 14" chip.
 * HOD, placement officer and verifier are `B2.3` and are not guessed at; an
 * account with no group reads "No mentor group", which is what the API said,
 * and never "No function", which would be a claim about grants nothing here can
 * read.
