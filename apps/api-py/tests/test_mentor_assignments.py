"""B9.1 — the assignment history, and the 90-day handover.

Four claims, and the third is the one the whole design turns on.

1. Every move writes a spell, the current pair is the OPEN row, and the same
   pair written twice writes nothing.
2. A release mints a `mentor.mentees` grant scoped to that ONE student, with a
   90-day expiry, and it is written ACTIVE — a handover that landed
   `pending_approval` would hold nothing on the single-admin deployment this
   product is built for.
3. THE GRANT RESTORES THE CAPABILITY, WHICH IS THE HAZARD THE BRANCH ALONE
   COULD NOT FIX. `mentor_functions_for` derives the four `mentor.*` keys live
   from `mentee_count > 0`, so a faculty member whose last mentee was just
   reassigned holds NONE of them and `require_capability` refuses at the door —
   before `assert_student_scope` runs at all. A handover honoured only inside
   rule 2 would be invisible to exactly the person it was built for.
4. THE WINDOW IS READ-ONLY. The same account that can now GET the student's
   notes is still refused the POST, because `allow_handover` is passed True at
   GET call sites only and the gate defaults it to False.

And two that say what the handover must NOT be:

5. A PROGRAMME-WIDE `mentor.mentees` grant does not open rule 2 for anybody.
   `holds_handover_for` matches the scope pair (STUDENT, this student) exactly
   and refuses `reaches_target`, which a programme-wide grant satisfies for
   every student alive. AGENTS.md: "a capability can never relax the student
   filter"; this is the test that keeps that true.
6. Revoking the grant closes the door the same second — which is the reason the
   window reads a grant rather than `mentor_assignments.to_at`.

    `Mentor` rows are never deleted and `mentorId` is baked into the session

    claim naming a live `Mentor` row. Keyed on "this session has a mentorId" —

    faculty member who has ever had one mentee, for every student they ever
    mentored, and after the grant was revoked or lapsed.

    `mentor.mentees` and `require_capability` lets them through the door — which
    is the only way `assert_student_scope` is reached at all. The handed-over
