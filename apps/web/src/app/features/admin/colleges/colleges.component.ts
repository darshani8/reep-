/**
 * Colleges — one card per college, and the Add-college card above them.
 *
 * ONE CARD PER COLLEGE, NOT A ROW IN A TABLE (2026-09-15). The screen used to
 * be a four-column grid with a status bar, a selection that only re-titled an
 * explanatory card, and a 380px side panel for the form. It is now the setup
 * screen's shape: each college is a card carrying the facts a stored value can
 * answer — code, campus, department count, email domains, college admin,
 * contact, status — and two buttons: "Open" (College structure, with this
 * college picked) and "Continue setup" (Set up a college, with this college
 * loaded). The card that described what a college admin may and may not do
 * was prose about the capability catalogue, which Who can do what already
 * lists, and it is gone with the selection that titled it.
 *
 * THIS SCREEN CREATES NOTHING (2026-09-15). It carried its own Add-college
 * form beside the header's "Set up a college" button — two buttons that both
 * created a college, and the owner named the repetition. The setup flow's
 * step 1 now takes every field the form took (code, name, campus, contact,
 * email domains), so the form is gone and the one thing it did that the flow
 * cannot — appointing a college admin — is an action on each card instead,
 * which also makes it possible for a college that already exists rather than
 * only at the moment of creation.
 *
 * `PATCH /api/admin/colleges/{id}` exists and NOTHING here reaches it: renaming
 * a college and archiving one are API-only from this screen. The DOMAINS are
 * edited on `features/admin/institution`, on the college it has picked,
 * through that same PATCH; this screen only reads them back on the card. Two
 * screens, one column, one writer — which is only safe while they agree about
 * what an empty list means, so both say it in the same words.
 *
 *   - registered email domains (`B1.1`) are `colleges.email_domains`, carried
 *     on `CollegeOut` and accepted by `CollegeIn`. An EMPTY list is not "nobody
 *     may join" — `app/institution_domains.py` falls back to the deployment's
 *     own `provisionable_email_domains` — so the card says "Deployment list"
 *     rather than showing a dash, which would read as a fence that admits no
 *     one.
 *   - the college admin (`B1.3`) is a FACULTY account holding the eleven scoped
 *     `admin.*` grants `COLLEGE_ADMIN_CAPABILITIES` names. `GET` and `POST
 *     /api/admin/colleges/{id}/admins` read and write them, and the card's
 *     "Appoint" form is a picker over `GET /api/admin/faculty` plus the reason
 *     the endpoint records.
 *
 * BOTH ADMIN ENDPOINTS ARE GATED ON `admin.governance`, NOT ON THIS SCREEN'S
 * `admin.institution` (`require_governance` in `app/routers/governance.py`),
 * and that is deliberate on the API's side: who holds what is Governance's
 * subject, so renaming a department must not also read the access map. A
 * granted faculty member therefore reaches this screen and cannot see or write
 * the college admin. The client checks `session.capabilities` to decide
 * whether to ASK — a filter that keeps a 403 off the screen, never an
 * authorisation; the API refuses regardless.
