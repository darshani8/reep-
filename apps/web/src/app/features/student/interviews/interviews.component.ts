/**
 * Student > Mock interviews — the durable record of every interview taken.
 *
 * The assistant screen is the live interview and forgets everything the moment
 * the tab closes. This screen is the other half: `interview_sessions`,
 * `interview_turns` and `interview_evaluations`, read back through the four
 * student endpoints in app/routers/interview_records.py. The subject is always
 * the caller — those endpoints take no `student_id` and adding one "for
 * symmetry" would make every one of them an IDOR the moment somebody forgot the
 * filter (docs/interview-engine-v3.md §7.3).
 *
 * WHY THIS SCREEN HAD TO EXIST THE DAY THE TABLES DID. The consent panel now
 * tells the student, in as many words, that their transcript is kept on the
 * college's server and that their mentor and the placement director can read
 * it. A promise like that with no way for the student to see the same record is
 * not a disclosure, it is a notice. This is where they read what was kept.
 *
 * LAZY, AND IT MUST STAY LAZY. Reached only through a `loadComponent` in
 * app.routes.ts. The initial bundle is ~142 kB against a budget set close enough
 * that one re-eager-ed route fails `ng build` in CI — a static `component:`
 * reference here would pull this screen, the report card and everything they
 * import into the chunk a student downloads before the login form paints.
