"""Setting up an approved student's account: link, code, password. In that order.

THE FLOW THIS REPLACES, and why. Under option B a student never held a
password: provisioning emailed an "enrolment notice" and they signed in with
their college Google account. That was a real design with real reasons, and it
was reversed deliberately on 2026-09-10 — students set a password now. Google
sign-in is untouched and still works for anyone who prefers it; what changed is
that it is no longer the *only* door a student has.

THREE STEPS, THREE DIFFERENT PROOFS. They are not ceremony:

  1. `POST /auth/onboard/start`     the invite link + the address typed back.
     The link proves somebody opened mail sent to the application's address.
     Typing the address back proves they know WHOSE account this is, which a
     link found in a shared inbox does not.
  2. `POST /auth/onboard/verify`    the six digits just mailed.
     This is the only step that proves the mailbox is READABLE RIGHT NOW. A
     forwarded invite survives step 1; it does not survive this.
  3. `POST /auth/onboard/password`  the ticket from step 2 + the new password.
     Accepts the ticket and NOT the invite link, so the code can never be
     skipped by someone holding the link alone.

AND IT DOES NOT SIGN ANYBODY IN. `/auth/activate` does, because a staff member
who just chose a password is plainly present. Here the last thing that happened
was a password being set on an account whose owner has proved a mailbox and
nothing else, so the flow ends at the login screen and the new password is
typed once more against the ordinary sign-in door — which applies the ordinary
brute-force limiter, the ordinary revocation and the ordinary single-device
retirement. One door, not two.

NEVER SAY WHETHER AN ADDRESS EXISTS, same rule as `forgot` in passwords.py: a
mismatched address at step 1 answers exactly what a bad link answers.

TWO MAILS LEAD HERE, ONE WALK. Provisioning sends the link the moment an
application is approved (`account_links.issue_onboarding`); "Forgot password?"
sends the same purpose of link to a STUDENT whose account holds no password
(`account_links.issue_password_setup`, 2026-09-16), because roster-seeded and
option-B students never got the first mail and had no other way to a
password. Nothing in these three steps knows or cares which mail it was.
