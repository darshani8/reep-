"""The Specialization Matrix and its interview state machine.

Two contracts are pinned here:

1. The matrix itself -- the four rows (HR, DM, BA, FA) with their personas,
   frameworks and sample questions are the product spec verbatim, so a test
   fails the moment a row goes missing or a field is left empty.

2. The state machine -- the phase arc (opening -> probing -> deep_dive ->
   wrap_up -> ended) is what steers the model mid-interview, and an illegal
   jump or a sticky-phase bug changes what every student is assessed against.

3. classify_answer -- the deterministic gate that decides whether an utterance
   advanced the interview. It runs on every turn between the student finishing
   and the interviewer replying, so it must stay a word count.

No database, no sockets: this module does no I/O by design.
