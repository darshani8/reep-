"""Resolving governance: what a staff member may use, and what a student has.

Two questions, two functions, and they are deliberately not the same shape:

    has_capability(db, session, key)      -> bool   staff, deny past the baseline
    feature_enabled(db, student_id, key)  -> bool   students, allow until switched off

and each has the refusal that goes with it, which is what the routers call:

    require_capability(db, session, key)  -> 403 "an administrator can grant it"
    require_feature(db, student_id, key)  -> 403 in the office's OWN WORDS

The asymmetry in those two sentences is the asymmetry in the model. A missing
capability is a staff member asking for something they were never given, and the
fix is a grant. A switched-off feature is something a student HAD and the office
took away for a stated reason, and the fix is a conversation — so the refusal
carries `student_message` from the winning override rather than boilerplate.

RULE 2 IS NOT IN THIS FILE, ON PURPOSE. `_assert_can_access_student` decides
WHICH STUDENTS a staff member may reach and lives in routers/mentor.py; this
decides WHICH SCREENS. Both must pass and they are checked separately, so a
capability can never relax the student filter — that is the safety argument, and
importing the two into one function would be the first step in losing it.

Nothing here caches. A grant revoked at 11:04 must stop working at 11:04, and a
per-process cache is how a revoked capability keeps working on three of five
workers until the next deploy.

#: What each role holds with no grant at all — exactly the screens it reaches
#: today. Introducing capability grants must not take anything away from anyone:
#: a deny-by-default rollout would have removed every mentor's own mentee log on
#: the deploy that shipped it. A grant is how someone gets what their role does
#: not already carry, which for a MENTOR is the programme-wide set.
#: DIRECTOR HOLDS NOTHING (2026-09-10), and this line is the one that decides it.
#:
#: The role removal touched the role gates first — `require_mentor`,
#: `require_admin`, `policies.STAFF_ROLES` — and for a few hours THIS map still
#: read `"DIRECTOR": _ALL - {"admin.interview_audio"}`. The result was worse than
#: leaving it alone: a DIRECTOR session was refused by every `require_*` gate and
#: still passed every `require_capability` one, which is roughly fifty endpoints
#: and the whole console — `admin.py`, `console.py`, the roster's
#: DELETE /api/admin/students/{id}, the exports CSV. Half a removal is a role
#: that cannot read its own mentee log but can delete the programme.
#:
#: An empty baseline is what makes "DIRECTOR grants nothing" true rather than
#: intended. The migration converts the rows; this closes the door for any row
#: that predates it, on a checkout where it has not run, or minted from an older
#: image. `tests/test_no_director_privilege.py` asserts both halves together.
#:
#: `admin.interview_audio` is still the one capability ADMIN alone holds nothing
#: extra to be said about — the asymmetry it recorded (a recording is an
#: operator's artefact containing a named student's voice, not placement
#: business) now lives entirely in MENTOR needing an explicit grant for it.
#: Faculty instruments. The Main Admin is not a faculty member: it has no
#: mentees, no private notebook, nobody's evidence to verify and no upskilling
#: shelf. These stay in the catalogue and stay SCOPED, so the Main Admin can
#: GRANT any of them in Governance -- to a faculty member, or to itself when a
#: student's evidence is stuck and nobody else will look -- and revoke them
#: again. `mentor.leave_approve` is NOT here: the Main Admin is the Program
#: Director, the second of the two approvers, and removing it breaks sanctioning.

    Four conditions, and two of them were missing at one time or another. Not
    revoked and not expired were always filtered here — in SQL rather than in
    Python, so a long-expired grant never reaches the process at all.
    `approval_state` was added for B2.4's two-person rule, written on every row,
    carried a check constraint and a docstring about four-eyes approval — and
    was read by NO query, so a grant awaiting a second Main Admin was fully live
    the moment it was inserted.

    `role_at_grant` is B2.5's, and it is the same shape of hole. A grant is a
    decision about a person IN A ROLE — "this MENTOR may read the registrations
    queue". Change the account's role and the sentence stops describing anybody,
    so the grant must stop counting; a grant that silently survives a role change
    is how a demoted account keeps a console screen with a live audit row saying
    it was given one.

    NULL `role_at_grant` IS HONOURED, NOT REFUSED. It means "granted before this
    column existed": the backfill cannot know which role was held at the time,
    and guessing would revoke real access on the deploy that shipped the guess.
    It is also what every GROUP grant carries, correctly — a grant to "the
    placement coordinators" is a decision about the group, and the role that
    matters there is the one each member holds when they join, which
    `AccessGroupMember` and the staff-only membership check already decide.

    `role` is optional so a caller that has not resolved one does not silently
    get an unfiltered read: every caller in this module passes it, and the
    parameter exists for the reads that genuinely have no subject (there are
    none today, and the next one should think about it rather than inherit a

    A cohort carries all three ancestor pointers rather than only the deepest,
