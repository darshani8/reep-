/**
 * The Playwright end-to-end suite: `npm run test:e2e` from the repository root.
 *
 * It lives at the ROOT and not in apps/web on purpose. The Angular unit-test
 * builder collects `*.spec.ts` files in its own project, so a Playwright spec
 * under apps/web would be run by vitest. And an end-to-end run needs only a
 * URL: it drives the SPA and the API over HTTP, exactly as a person at a
 * browser does.
 *
 * Every test is the automated twin of a case in
 * test-management/manual-test-cases.md, linked by the `@TC-NNN` tag in its
 * title. The CSV reporter writes one row per case to manual-test-results.csv
 * and fails the run if the two files have drifted apart.
