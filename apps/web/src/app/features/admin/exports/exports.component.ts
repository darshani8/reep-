/**
 * Exports — the spreadsheets a placement office actually forwards.
 *
 * The approved board is `docs/redesign-2026-09/design/admin/Exports.html` and
 * the brief is `02-admin-console-spec.md` §22. A grid of report cards, not a
 * builder: each card that downloads anything is a real endpoint behind the
 * console's own gate, and the download is a plain `<a href>` so the browser
 * streams the file to disk rather than a fetch buffering a CSV into memory to
 * re-offer it.
 *
 * B14 HAS LANDED, and three of the four things this screen used to call
 * unbuilt are now real (`app/exports.py`, `app/routers/console.py`):
 *
 *   - SCOPE. Every extract runs through `scope_filter(db, session,
 *     "admin.exports")`, so a department-scoped grant downloads its department
 *     and not the programme. The caller's own reach is stated on the history
 *     card, from the ONE B14 endpoint that has a body to put it in
 *     (`GET /api/admin/exports/history` answers `{scope, events}`; the three
 *     CSVs state the same fact in response headers, because a JSON envelope
 *     around a CSV is not a CSV). It is stated in the three words the server
 *     uses — `programme`, `narrowed`, `none` — and never collapsed to a
 *     boolean: "may see everything" and "may see nothing" are opposite facts.
 *   - PERSONAL COLUMNS. `PERSONAL_COLUMN_CAPABILITY` in `app/exports.py` is
 *     `admin.students`, the ROSTER function — not `carries_pii`, which
 *     `admin.exports` itself is flagged with and which would therefore be true
 *     for every caller. So the card's chip and the column line under it are
 *     drawn from the session's own functions: a holder without the roster
 *     function gets a file whose Name and USN columns are dropped, header and
 *     cell, and printing "Carries name & USN" over that file would be as wrong
 *     as the board's "No personal fields" over a file that carries both.
 *   - THE HISTORY. Every download writes an `export_events` row, and the grid
 *     below reads them. A NARROWED holder sees only their own receipts, by the
 *     endpoint's own rule, which is why the reach is spelled out beside them.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED WITH PHASE 4, AND WHAT IS STILL A DRAWING:
 *
 *   - The board gives every card a row count ("118 rows") and a last-generated
 *     date. There is no report store and no endpoint that counts a file's rows
 *     without generating it, so no count is drawn. The only date on a card is
 *     the one THIS browser remembers about its own downloads, and it says so;
 *     the authoritative dates are in the history grid.
 *   - INTERVIEWS IS LIVE NOW. B6.7 shipped `GET /api/admin/interviews/
 *     export.csv` — the summary-only extract B14 names, reading
 *     `interview_score_summaries` so a file taken in September still contains
 *     March. It answers to `admin.interviews`, NOT to this screen's
 *     `admin.exports`, so the card is gated on that key the same way the badge
 *     report is gated on the office account: a live `<a download>` over a 403
 *     saves the refusal to disk named `.csv` and records it here as a success.
 *   - Registrations and Leave are drawn as extracts on the board and have no
 *     endpoint — and no task defines one. `04-backend-changes.md` §B14 names
 *     only the Interviews extract; B10 and B11 add screens and decisions, not
 *     files. So those two cards carry their REAL reason and no phase number:
 *     naming a phase for a file nobody has specified is the stale promise the
 *     pending directive's docstring warns about.
 *   - "Schedule an export" is `02-admin-console-spec.md` §22's own "(optional,
 *     later)" — no task in `04-backend-changes.md` defines it and no phase
 *     carries it. It is disabled with THAT as its reason rather than a phase
 *     number, because naming a phase would promise a date nothing has agreed.
 *
 * THE BADGE REPORT IS NOT ON THE BOARD AND IS KEPT ANYWAY. It is a working
 * download on main; deleting a live extract to match a drawing is a regression
 * the board never asked for. It carries its own warning: the screen is reached
 * with the `admin.exports` capability, but `/admin/badges/export.csv` is
 * `require_admin` — deliberately, so the file cannot have a weaker lock than
 * the cohort screen that renders the same data — so for a granted faculty
 * member that one card renders DISABLED with the reason on it. A live link
 * there is worse than a dead one: `<a download>` saves whatever comes back,
 * so a 403 body lands on the officer's disk named `.csv` and this browser's
 * "last downloaded" line records it as a success.
 *
 * `/admin/audit` is `roleGuard('ADMIN')` (`admin.governance` is not the gate
 * on that route), so the history card's "Open audit log" is offered to the
 * office account only rather than bouncing off a guard.
