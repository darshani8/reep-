"""B8.5 — the weekly series, the KPI strip and mentor-load pagination.

THE PROPERTY RUNNING THROUGH ALL OF IT is the one 07 §5 states and
`app/scope_views.py` restates: a number nobody measured must not render as a
number somebody measured. An analytics screen is where that failure is most
expensive, because the office ACTS on it — a flat zero line across a term reads
as a collapse and not as "no import has been run".

So every point, every KPI value and every delta here is nullable, and each
series carries the reason it is what it is. The tests below pin, in order:

1. `test_the_series_answers_and_is_shaped_by_the_window` — it exists at all, and
   `?weeks=` is bounded.
2. `test_a_week_with_no_sessions_is_null_and_not_zero` — the guardrail.
   Attendance is NULL for a week nobody recorded a session in; skilling hours
   are 0.0 for a week nobody logged, because those are opposite facts (nobody
   RECORDS a session that did not happen; a self-report of nothing IS a
   measurement of the cohort).
3. `test_readiness_has_no_history_and_says_so` — the honest half of B8.5. There
   is no record of what a student's CGPA was in week 7, so that series is
   `partial` with only the last point filled and a sentence explaining it,
   rather than a fabricated line or a silent absence.
4. `test_the_mock_interview_kpi_refuses_to_invent_a_definition` — cross-area
   discipline: the one definition of a mock interview is B6.3's, and a second
   one written here would disagree with the interview records screen the first
   time either moved.
5. `test_a_scope_over_no_students_draws_no_line` and
   `test_a_reach_of_nothing_says_so_differently` — no line over nobody, the
   legend and the KPI strip keep their shape, and "you may see nothing"
   does not read the same as "there is nothing".
6. `test_both_endpoints_are_scoped_and_stamp_the_header` — they are new members
   of B1.4's family and must behave like the rest of it.
7. `test_mentor_load_pages_without_changing_its_shape` — pagination is opt-in
   and stated in headers, because four Angular screens are built against
   `list[MentorLoadOut]`.
