# tools/ci/preflight.sh — run the checks that gate `main`, here, before you push.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. With the ruleset on `main` applied there is no route to main
# except a pull request whose required checks conclude success, so a mistake in a
# diff is no longer discovered by you — it is discovered by a runner, minutes
# later, after you have stopped thinking about the change. Every command below is
# the SAME command .github/workflows/ci.yml runs, in the order that fails
# fastest, so the answer is available before the push instead of after it.
#
# WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not a gate, and nothing on a laptop is one: this file
# is invoked by nothing, it is trivially skipped, and its exit code is read by no
# one but you. The authority is the required status checks on the pull request.
# This is the fast copy, not the ruling.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/ci/preflight.sh [--quick] [--keep-going] [--clean-deps] [--npm-ci]
#                         [--skip-db-setup] [--no-color] [-h|--help]
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  every check passed
#   1  at least one check FAILED — the pull request will be red
#   2  nothing failed, but at least one check did not RUN. A check that did not
#      run is not a check that passed; CI runs it regardless. This is the same
#      distinction REEP_REQUIRE_DB=1 draws in apps/api-py/tests/conftest.py, and
#      for the same reason: a silent skip reports success having verified nothing.

tools/ci/preflight.sh - the CI jobs that gate main, run locally, before you push.

  --quick          Run only the fast checks: "API (dependency completeness)",
                   Rule 1, the design-system guards and the Angular typecheck.
                   Seconds, not minutes.
                   NOT SUFFICIENT FOR A PULL REQUEST - it does not run pytest,
                   ng test or ng build, and those are inside required checks
                   that run whether you did or not.
  --keep-going     Run every check even after one fails, instead of stopping at
                   the first. Slower, but you learn everything in one pass.
  --clean-deps     Run the two dependency-completeness checks the way CI does:
                   in a THROWAWAY virtualenv built from the manifest alone.
                   This is the honest version and the slow one - it downloads
                   the full dependency set. Without it those two checks run in
                   your existing venvs, which is a weaker question (see below).
  --npm-ci         Run `npm ci` in apps/web first, as the Web job does, instead
                   of trusting the node_modules you already have.
  --skip-db-setup  Do not run `alembic upgrade head` / `python -m app.seed`
                   before pytest. Use it when you are mid-way through testing
                   something by hand and do not want the dev dataset rewritten.
  --no-color       Plain output. NO_COLOR in the environment does the same.
  -h, --help       This text.

Checks, in the order they run, named exactly as the CI jobs are named:

  1. API (dependency completeness)             seconds
  2. Rule 1 (every model call declares its cargo)   seconds
  3. Web (Angular)                             design guards, typecheck, tests, build
  4. API (FastAPI + Postgres)                  migrations, seed, pytest - needs Postgres

  Infra (CDK synth guards) is the fifth required check and is NOT run here: it
  needs its own Python 3.12 environment under infra/cdk and only matters when
  infra/ is touched. Run it with: cd infra/cdk && python -m pytest -q

# failure on a machine where numpy had not been pip-installed by hand for

# acceptable; it only moves the crash from boot to the first student who
