"""Interview Engine v3 §6 — the four record tables, and the constraints that
have to BITE rather than merely exist.

Every guarantee pinned here is one the application code is allowed to lean on,
and each one is load-bearing for a specific failure the design names:

  * `uq_interview_turn_provider` — the SECOND dedup layer. The relay's own
    `_pending.pop` protects the state machine; this protects the row when a
    transcription is delivered twice, or a `.failed` lands after a `.completed`.
    The turn writer swallows the IntegrityError as the no-op it is, which is only
    safe if the constraint is really there.
  * `(interview_session_id, seq)` is deliberately NOT unique. That is tested too,
    because "someone added unique=True for tidiness" is a silent way to turn a
    cosmetic duplicate into a fire-and-forget writer that raises and loses turns.
  * `uq_interview_evaluation_session` — one scorecard per interview, which is
    what makes the evaluation write idempotent when the report's `response.done`
    arrives after the deadline already wrote `report_status='timeout'` (DF6).
  * The delete rules, all four of them, exercised as BULK deletes so it is the
    DATABASE being tested and not SQLAlchemy's in-memory cascade. `purge_expired`
    issues exactly that kind of bulk delete, so an ORM-only rule would pass a
    unit test and fail the retention job.
  * Finalize-exactly-once: three layers race to close a session and the only
    thing making them idempotent is the `status = 'running'` predicate. This
    pins the predicate, not the callers.
  * `content = ''` is legal (L4). A failed or timed-out transcription writes an
    empty string with a status saying why, and that row is the entire reason this
    table exists — a NOT NULL that also rejected '' would lose it.

Pure database tests: no TestClient, no socket, no relay. Skipped when Postgres is
unreachable (and REEP_REQUIRE_DB=1 turns that skip into a hard error, because a
green suite that verified none of this is worse than a red one).
