/**
 * Jobs sheet — the openings the placement office publishes (spec §14, board

 *
 * Students and alumni read the same `jobs` table, so "Publish" is one POST and
 * the posting is on both boards at once.
 *
 * WHAT IS LIVE, AND ON WHICH ENDPOINT.
 *   GET    /api/admin/jobs             the grid, with each posting's applicant
 *                                       count, its college/course/tracks and its
 *                                       open-or-withdrawn state
 *   POST   /api/admin/jobs             Publish, and Duplicate (which is Publish
 *                                       with the selected posting typed back
 *                                       into the form)
 *   POST   /api/admin/jobs/{id}/close  Close posting — takes it off the student
 *                                       and alumni boards without touching the
 *                                       applications against it
 *   DELETE /api/admin/jobs/{id}        Remove — REFUSED 409 once anyone has
 *                                       applied, in the server's own words
 *   GET    /api/admin/criteria         the programme's placement criteria, which
 *                                       is where the form's two eligibility gates
 *                                       come from; read-only here
 *   GET    /api/admin/catalogue/courses the flat course picker the Scope field
 *                                       offers. `admin.catalogue`, NOT this
 *                                       screen's `admin.jobs` — so it can be
 *                                       refused, and the field then says so
 *
 * CLOSE AND REMOVE ARE BOTH HERE AND THEY ARE DIFFERENT ACTS. Remove deletes
 * the posting and the server refuses it with a 409 once anybody has applied,
 * because those applications are part of students' records. Close leaves every
 * row where it is and flips `jobs.status`, which is the ONLY thing the two
 * candidate feeds filter on — so it is the action for the posting that has done
 * its work, and the one that works on a posting people applied to. It is
 * one-way by design: the server has no reopen, so the button asks first.
 *
 * THE THREE FILTERS NARROW WHAT IS DRAWN, NEVER WHAT MAY BE READ. `GET
 * /api/admin/jobs` takes no query parameters and is scoped server-side (B1.4);
 * college, course and track are all on every row, so the selects narrow the
 * array already in hand — the Leave queue's Department filter, exactly. Picking
 * a college INCLUDES the postings that name none, because that is what a
 * student at that college actually sees (`app/jobs_visibility.py::
 * visible_clauses`); a filter that hid them would answer a different question
 * from the one the office is asking.
 *
 * WHAT THE BOARD DRAWS THAT NOTHING ANSWERS is listed once in the screen's
 * `.notice.accent` and again in the column's header tooltip: CTC and Openings,
 * which no backend task adds at all, and the eligible denominator under
 * "Applied". Each renders an em dash or a disabled control. A plausible number
 * in a screenshot is indistinguishable from working software.
