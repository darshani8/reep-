/**
 * Catalogue — what students may enrol in, and which certifications count.
 *
 * The board (docs/redesign-2026-09/design/admin/Catalogue.html) draws four
 * tabs over two different kinds of thing, and only two of the four have a
 * backend today. What each one is, and why it renders the way it does:
 *
 *  SUBJECTS are the curriculum, grouped by semester, with the certifications
 *  mapped to each and how many students are enrolled. There is still no
 *  per-subject form, and the reason is unchanged: a subject carries a code, a
 *  stage, a dimension, a semester and a delivery model, and a four-field form
 *  cannot supply those without inventing them. What B13 added is the way an
 *  office actually maintains a curriculum — "Import subjects", a CSV through
 *  `POST /admin/catalogue/subjects/import`, whose `dry_run` DEFAULTS TO TRUE
 *  on the server because its input is a file somebody exported from a
 *  spreadsheet. The panel follows that: the Import button does nothing until a
 *  dry run has reported, every row is listed including the failures, and a
 *  subject code being global across the deployment means a scoped grant is
 *  refused rather than writing a row every other college would then see.
 *
 *  B13 ALSO MOVED THE CERTIFICATION LIST ONTO THIS SCREEN'S OWN FUNCTION.
 *  The three `/admin/approved-certifications` handlers were `require_admin`
 *  while the screen itself opened on the grantable `admin.catalogue`, and this
 *  file carried a signal and a paragraph apologising for the split. They are
 *  `require_capability(db, session, "admin.catalogue")` now, so a 403 there
 *  means the grant does not REACH the row — the defensive branch stays,
 *  because a refusal must not render as "no certifications", but its sentence
 *  says the true thing.
 *
 *  CERTIFICATIONS ↔ BADGES is the Approved Certification Catalogue
 *  (framework §12), the list administration genuinely maintains: which
 *  external certificates count as evidence towards which badge. The grid is by
 *  BADGE because that is the question the screen answers — which of the 48
 *  badges a student can actually reach, and which have nothing mapped to them
 *  yet. THE BADGE CATALOGUE IS CODE (AGENTS.md, models/badge.py), so this
 *  screen offers no add, no edit and no retire for a badge; the board's "Add
 *  badge" and "Retire badge" would be buttons with no endpoint behind them and
 *  never will have one. What it does offer is the mapping: "Add certification"
 *  writes an approved certification against a badge, and "Remove" DEACTIVATES
 *  rather than deletes, so evidence students have already filed keeps its
 *  reference and the row can be brought back.
 *
 *  Category and Points are read off the badge (never typed), so the two can
 *  never disagree with the catalogue.
 *
 *  STAGE RULES are real: `GET/PUT/DELETE /admin/catalogue/stage-rules`, one
 *  row per (course, semester), and `POST /admin/cohorts/{id}/promote` reads
 *  them. The PUT is an UPSERT because `uq_stage_rule_course_semester` makes a
 *  second rule for one semester an IntegrityError — the unique key IS the
 *  identity of the thing being edited — and the DELETE is a real delete,
 *  because nothing hangs off a rule and a promotion with no rule simply leaves
 *  the stage alone. The tab keeps THREE states apart: not read, read and
 *  empty, and read with rows. The first two must never render the same
 *  sentence.
 *
 *  THE TWO SCOPE PILLS filter on `college_id` / `course_id`, which every
 *  certification row now carries — and BOTH NULL IS PROGRAMME-WIDE, so
 *  neither pill hides such a row. That is the same reading
 *  `list_approved_certifications` gives `?course_id=` ("the course's own rows
 *  PLUS the programme-wide ones"), and a client filter that read it any other
 *  way would disagree with the endpoint beside it and empty the grid on the
 *  day somebody first picked a college. The college list is learned from the
 *  course rows rather than fetched: `GET /admin/colleges` is
 *  `admin.institution`, a different function from this screen's.
 *
 *  "COPY TO COURSE…" IS ONE FLAT SEARCHABLE LIST, NOT THE BOARD'S TWO-STEP.
 *  The endpoint is `{from_course, to_course, parts[]}` — the owner's settled
 *  decision — so a college select followed by a course select would be two
 *  controls and two round trips to answer one question on a deployment with
 *  one college. Every row carries its college's name and the search matches
 *  it. The copy is additive and never overwrites; the dry run is offered
 *  first, because the useful moment to learn that eleven of twelve rows
 *  already exist is before the copy.
 *
 *  INTERVIEW TRACKS are real and READ-ONLY here: the four tracks the mock
 *  interviewer runs, from `GET /api/admin/interview-questions/tracks`. That
 *  endpoint is the Question bank's, and its capability is
 *  `admin.interview_questions` — an account holding only `admin.catalogue`
 *  gets a 403, which is a fact about the grant and not an error, so it is
 *  reported as a note rather than as a failure.
 *
 * ONE COLUMN DIFFERS FROM THE BOARD ON PURPOSE. The board's "Earned" column
 * needs a per-badge earned count, which no endpoint computes today. The column
 * shows CLAIMS instead — evidence rows filed against this badge's
 * certifications, a real number that arrives with the certifications — and the
 * note above the grid says so. A dash in every row would have been the other
 * honest option; a number nobody computed would not.
