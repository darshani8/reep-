"""Who mentored whom, from when to when, and who decided — B9.1.

WHY A TABLE AND NOT A COLUMN, said the way `student_semester_history` says it:
`students.mentor_id` is a POSITION. It answers "who mentors this student now"
and destroys the answer to "who mentored them before, when did that change, who
moved them and why". The pointer stays exactly where it is and stays the single
thing rule 2 filters on; this is history BESIDE it, never a replacement. Nothing
reads a mentor's current group from here, and `mentor_functions.py`'s argument
against a stored copy of "do you mentor anybody" is untouched: that question is
still asked of `students.mentor_id`, live.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE ROW IS A PERIOD, AND A PERIOD HAS TWO ENDS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One row per (student, mentor) spell. `to_at IS NULL` means the spell is open,
which is what makes "one open row per current pair" a statement a query can
check rather than a convention a writer has to remember.

04's column list is `(student_id, mentor_id, from_at, to_at, by_user_id, reason,
kind)` — ONE `by_user_id`, ONE `reason`, ONE `kind` — and that list cannot
describe a period, because a period is opened by one act and closed by another.
Written that way, a reassignment either overwrites who made the original
assignment (losing "who seated this student with Dr Rao, and why") or leaves the
closing act unrecorded (losing "who moved them off, and why"), and the second
question is the one the mentor-load screen's history card exists to answer. So
there are two sets of three:

    kind / by_user_id / reason              the act that OPENED this spell
    end_kind / ended_by_user_id / end_reason   the act that CLOSED it

and all four of 04's `kind` values live across the two columns:
`assign` / `reassign` open, `release` / `reassign` / `faculty_disabled` close.
Neither set is ever rewritten once written.

`kind` IS A PLAIN STRING, NOT A PG ENUM — the house rule
`app/models/semester_history.py` and `app/models/institution.py` both state, for
the stated reason: this vocabulary will grow (`graduated`, `transferred`,
`cohort_moved` are all plausible), and a new value should be a data change and
not a `CREATE TYPE` migration carrying all three of AGENTS.md's enum gotchas.
`capability_grants.capability` and `auth_tokens.purpose` are String for the same
reason. It is validated at the API edge against the tuples below.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`from_at` IS NULLABLE, AND THE NULL MEANS SOMETHING
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every pair standing on the day this table arrived was seated by a writer that
kept no record of when. The migration seeds those rows from `students.created_at`
where the pointer and the account plausibly date together, and NULL where it
cannot: a NULL `from_at` reads as **"mentoring since before this was recorded"**
and the history card says exactly that. The one thing it must never be is
`now()`, which would tell every reader that the whole roster was seated on
deploy day.

A student who has never had a mentor gets NO ROW AT ALL. "Never had a mentor"
and "has had one since forever" are different facts and an empty history must
not be able to say the second.
