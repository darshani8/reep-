"""Phase 4c · B6.2, B6.3, B6.5 and B6.7 — the parts of an interview that
OUTLIVE it, who read them, and who looked.

Four features, one test module, because they are one sentence: an interview
produces four numbers; those numbers are copied somewhere the 180-day clock does
not reach; they feed a student's trend, their readiness and their home chart;
and every staff read of the record they came from leaves a line the student can
read back.

The five properties this file exists to pin, each of which is a bug somebody
would otherwise ship:

1. **A NULL SCORE IS NEVER A ZERO.** It is the guardrail AGENTS.md states twice
   and the one 4b had to fix elsewhere. Asserted on the summary row, on the
   trend's aggregates, on the readiness factor, on the KPI average and in the
   CSV, because each of those is a separate place somebody would write
   `or 0`.

2. **A STUDENT WHO HAS NOT PRACTISED IS NOT LESS PLACEMENT-READY.** The new
   readiness factor is `measured=False` with no score, which takes it out of
   BOTH sides of the arithmetic — so the score is unchanged. A weight-2 factor
   scored as `met=False` would have dropped every un-practised student by ~14
   points on the deploy.

3. **THE SUMMARY SURVIVES THE PURGE.** `retention.purge_expired` hard-deletes
   the session and cascades to the turns and the evaluation. The summary must
   be standing afterwards with a NULL `session_id` — if it is not, B6.2 does
   nothing at all in production and looks correct in every other test.

4. **BOTH FENCES ON THE NEW GRID.** `admin.interviews` decides whether a caller
   may open it and how far their grant reaches; rule 2 still narrows a MENTOR to
   their own group on top. A capability can never relax the student filter.

5. **THE ACCESS LOG RECORDS READS THAT HAPPENED.** A row is written after the
   gates, for by-id reads only, and never for a 404 — a log that says a mentor
   opened a record they were refused is worse than no log, because the student
   reads it.

It builds its own app, like `test_interview_access.py` and for its reason: the
subject is the routers, not `app/main.py`'s wiring, which has its own test.
