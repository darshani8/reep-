/**
 * Students & batches — the Main Admin's roster (spec §5, board
 * `design/admin/Students.html`).
 *
 * NO CREATE AND NO DELETE (2026-09-10, AGENTS.md). A student account is minted
 * by exactly one path — approving a registration, which records an
 * application, a reason and a reviewer and then makes the person prove their
 * mailbox — so this screen draws no "Add student" control, only a link to that
 * queue. `POST /admin/students` and `DELETE /admin/students/{id}` answer 405,
 * deliberately, and a screen that drew either would be a button that can never
 * work. The one destructive action here is `DELETE /admin/cohorts/{id}` for an
 * EMPTY batch; empty a batch by MOVING its students out.
 *
 * WHAT IS LIVE, AND ON WHICH ENDPOINT.
 *   GET    /api/admin/students?cohort_id=|unseated=&q=  the grid
 *   PATCH  /api/admin/students/{id}                     edit one student, and
 *                                                       the selection actions,
 *                                                       one student at a time
 *   POST   /api/admin/cohorts/{id}/students/bulk        a whole batch at once
 *   DELETE /api/admin/cohorts/{id}                      an EMPTY batch
 *   GET    /api/register/hierarchy                      colleges → departments →
 *                                                       courses →
 *                                                       specializations →
 *                                                       batches
 *   GET    /api/admin/mentor-load                       every faculty account
 *   GET    /api/admin/cohorts/{id}/promotion-history    what has been done to
 *                                                       THIS batch
 *
 * THE PROMOTION HISTORY CARD IS LIVE (B4.3/B4.4). It is asked per batch,
 * because that is the only shape the endpoint answers, and it has four states
 * that are four different facts: no batch chosen, reading, read and empty, and
 * REFUSED. The endpoint deliberately refuses a holder who reaches only part of
 * a batch rather than returning the part they may see — so a refusal that
 * rendered as "nothing on record" would report the opposite of the truth.
 *
 * NO READINESS, CGPA OR ATTENDANCE COLUMNS. The board drew them and
 * `GET /api/admin/students` carries none of the three — it answers identity,
 * seating and stage — so they were always a dash. A roster that fetched them
 * from Student 360 would be one request per ROW on every page. Removed on
 * 2026-09-15; they are read per student on the student's own record.
 *
 * THE SELECTION ACTIONS ARE REAL, one PATCH per student. B9.3 will make
 * "assign N selected" a single audited request; until it exists the honest
 * version of that button is the loop, which writes exactly what the row editor
 * writes through exactly the same endpoint, and reports how many landed.
 *
 * The row shapes and the grid's columns live beside this file, in
 * `roster-row.ts` and `roster-grid.ts`.
