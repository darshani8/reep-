"""Assistant retention & aged-data redaction (Assistant V2 Phase D, review #9;
interview records added by Interview Engine v3 §6.7 layer 3 and §6.8).

Memory does not live forever. Three jobs keep stored data on a lifecycle instead
of letting it accumulate indefinitely:

* ``purge_expired`` walks conversations AND interview records: one whose
  ``retention_until`` has passed is SOFT-deleted (``deleted_at`` stamped) —
  recoverable-shaped but hidden — and the free text it still carries through the
  grace window is PII-scrubbed with ``app.redaction.redact_pii``. Anything
  soft-deleted for longer than the grace window is HARD-deleted. The two subjects
  share one function on purpose: **one retention story in this codebase, not
  two.** A second module with its own clock and its own grace window is how a
  student's transcript ends up outliving the conversation it was quoted from.
* ``redact_expired_runs`` walks the ``AgentRun`` audit trail: a run older than the
  window keeps its METRICS (status, intent, resolved, duration_ms, model) but has
  its free text (question, answer, trace, citations) replaced with the redaction
  sentinel — so long-run analytics survive without holding a student's words.
* ``finalize_orphaned_interviews`` is the THIRD and last finalization layer for
  ``interview_sessions`` (§6.7). Layers 1 and 2 — the relay's own finalizer and
  the router's ``finally:`` backstop — both need the process to still be alive.
  This one is the answer to ``kill -9``: a ``running`` row whose heartbeat went
  stale becomes an honest ``abandoned`` instead of a row that reads as still live
  forever. A ``running`` row that is never closed is worse than no row, because
  it is a record that lies.

All three are IDEMPOTENT (a second pass is a no-op) and pure functions of ``now``
so a test can pin the clock.

**What is wired and what is not.** ``finalize_orphaned_interviews`` IS called
once at startup from ``app/main.py``'s lifespan — a worker that just restarted is
exactly the process that knows the previous one died, so a deploy or a
crash-restart sweeps its own orphans with no cron at all. ``purge_expired`` and
``redact_expired_runs`` are still NOT wired: they delete student data on a clock,
which is a deployment decision, and running them from every boot would make the
amount of data destroyed a function of how often someone restarts the API.

def _delete_interview_audio(rows: Sequence[InterviewSession]) -> tuple[int, list[str]]:
    """Sweep the audio store for **every** session in ``rows``, not only the ones
    whose row admits to having audio.

    Returns ``(sessions_whose_audio_was_destroyed, blocked_session_ids)``. A
    session id in the second list is one whose bytes are still on disk, and its
    database row **must not be hard-deleted this pass** — see the reasoning below.

    **DO NOT "OPTIMISE" THIS BACK INTO A FLAG TEST.** It used to select
    ``[r for r in rows if r.audio_recorded or r.audio_path]``, and that filter is
    exactly how a named student's voice outlives its retention window. Those two
    columns record what the RELAY BELIEVED and managed to write down; the whole
    failure mode is that the relay may have died before it could write anything
    down. A session whose Layer 1 finalizer never ran — an exception its
    ``except*`` clauses do not match — still has its files closed by ``run()``'s
    ``finally``, so the bytes are on disk while the row says ``audio_recorded =
    false, audio_path = NULL``. Filtering on the row asks the wrong witness. The
    filesystem is the authority on which files exist.

    The unconditional call costs nothing because ``delete_session_audio`` is a
    no-op for a session that never recorded — see its contract, which states that
    property precisely so this call site can rely on it: files are named after
    the ``interview_sessions.id``, so the session's primary key alone finds them,
    and a missing file (or a store directory that was never created, which is
    every deployment with recording disabled) is success rather than an error.
    That is what makes an unconditional sweep the fix here, rather than the
    reconciliation pass this module and the store both used to sketch: no store
    listing, no second delete path, no new state.

    THIS IS THE SINGLE INTEGRATION POINT for the interview-audio store. Every
    other line of this module speaks only to Postgres, where a delete is
    transactional and either happens or does not. Audio is a file on a disk: the
    delete is not in our transaction, it can half-succeed, and it is a named
    student's recorded voice. Keeping that in one function means the next editor
    changes it in one place, and means "does retention delete the audio?" has one
    answer rather than a grep.

    The import stays guarded even though the store now exists: this module's
    other three jobs — conversations, ``AgentRun`` redaction, the orphan sweeper
    — speak only to Postgres and must keep working if ``app/interview_audio.py``
    is ever moved, renamed or stripped from a slim image. An ``ImportError`` here
    is reported and made safe, never fatal to the whole sweep.

    The contract this expects of the store, stated here because this is its only
    caller::

        # app/interview_audio.py
        def delete_session_audio(interview_session_id: str, audio_path: str | None = None) -> int:
            '''Remove any stored audio for this interview; return files removed.

            IDEMPOTENT: an already-missing file is success, not an error — the
            reaper retries, and a second pass must not start raising.
            A NO-OP for a session that never recorded, store directory or not.
            RAISES only when bytes are believed to still be on disk.
            '''

    **A session whose audio could not be deleted keeps its database row.** That
    is the deliberate direction to fail, and it is the same reasoning §6.7 gives
    for the orphan sweeper: deleting the row would leave a recording of a named
    student on disk with *nothing left pointing at it* — undiscoverable, so
    undeletable by anyone who later has to answer for it. A row that outlives its
    retention window by one sweep is visible and arguable. An orphaned voice file
    is neither.

    Layers 1 and 2 — the relay's own finalizer and the router's ``finally:``
    backstop — both require this process to still be alive to run. Neither
    survives ``kill -9``, an OOM kill, or a container that was cut off
    mid-interview, and every one of those leaves a row that says ``running``
    forever: a record that lies, on a student's history screen, next to real
    interviews. This is the layer that needs nothing of the dead process except
    the last heartbeat it managed to write.

    The predicate is a **stale heartbeat**, never an elapsed ``started_at``. By
    ``started_at`` alone a long healthy interview and a dead one are
    indistinguishable, and the sweeper would end live calls.
    ``settings.interview_orphan_grace_seconds`` (1200 = ``interview_max_seconds``
    900 + 300 s of slack) sits comfortably past the longest legal interview, so a
    healthy session is never a candidate.

    ``ended_at`` is set to ``heartbeat_at``, **not** ``now``. The interview ended
    when the heartbeat stopped; stamping ``now`` would inflate every orphaned
    session's duration by however long the sweeper took to be run — which, since
    the usual trigger is the next deploy, could be days.

    Idempotent by construction: the ``status = 'running'`` predicate is the same
    guard layers 1 and 2 use, so whichever finalizer gets there first wins and
    the others update zero rows. It never overwrites a terminal status, so a
    session that ended honestly is never relabelled ``abandoned``.

    **The failure direction, stated so nobody has to rediscover it.** If the
    relay's heartbeat write fails all session long, ``heartbeat_at`` stays at
    ``started_at`` and this function will mark a perfectly healthy, still-running
    interview ``abandoned``. That is wrong, and it is the correct way to be
    wrong: a session wrongly marked abandoned is visible on a screen and someone
    argues about it, while a session stuck at ``running`` forever is invisible
    and nobody ever does. Do not "fix" this by loosening the predicate.
