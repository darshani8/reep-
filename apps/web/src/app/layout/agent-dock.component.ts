/**
 * The floating assistant — the REEP Agent and the mock interviewer, in one
 * panel under the one orb.
 *
 * WHY ONE PANEL. The design put a single orb on every screen, and the product
 * had two assistants behind two routes: the typed REEP Agent
 * (POST /api/agent/ask) and the spoken mock interviewer (a WebSocket to
 * /api/interview). A student who wanted to rehearse had to know a screen
 * existed and find it from the landing card. The dock puts both where the orb
 * is: "Ask REEP" and "Mock interview" are two tabs of one panel, and the panel
 * opens on whatever screen the student is on.
 *
 * NOTHING IS COPIED. Each tab renders the same component its page renders —
 * `shared/agent-chat` (also /student/agent, /mentor/agent, /admin/agent) and
 * `shared/interview-room` (also /student/assistant) — in their `dock`
 * variant. The pages stay as the deep links; "Open as a page" in the bar goes
 * to them.
 *
 * BOTH TABS ARE `@defer`RED. The interview room pulls InterviewService
 * (~2 900 lines of audio pipeline) and the visualizer (~2 000) behind it; the
 * chat is smaller but not free. The shell is in the INITIAL bundle and the
 * production budget is set close to it (AGENTS.md, "Routes are lazy"), so a
 * tab's component is fetched the first time that tab is shown and not before.
 * `askSeen` / `roomSeen` are sticky: once a tab has been shown, its block is
 * rendered whichever tab is in front.
 *
 * THE INACTIVE TAB IS HIDDEN, NOT DESTROYED. A live interview must survive a
 * glance at the other tab: destroying the room ends the interview (its
 * ngOnDestroy releases the microphone — AGENTS.md rule 1), so the panels are
 * toggled with `hidden` and the room lives for as long as the dock is open.
 * Closing the dock DOES destroy it, and that is the one moment the microphone
 * is released without an End press — so closing over a live interview asks
 * first, in the bar, with the words saying what closing does. Escape asks the
 * same question.
 *
 * MOCK INTERVIEW IS A STUDENT TAB. The backend refuses anyone else, so staff
 * and alumni get the one tab rather than a second tab that 403s.
