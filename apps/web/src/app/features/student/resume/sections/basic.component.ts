/**
 * Resume Builder — "Basic Details" section (stepper key `basic`).
 *
 * Editable demographics live in the shared profile map under `data.basic`
 * ({ middle_name, gender, dob, blood_group, marital_status, languages[],
 * dream_company, medical_history }). Identity fields the university owns — USN,
 * first/last name, course, specialization — are rendered LOCKED: the name comes
 * from the signed-in session (AuthService) and the USN is read best-effort from
 * GET /student/dashboard, mirroring student/profile.component.ts. Course and
 * specialization have no client-visible source yet, so they show as locked and
 * empty rather than inventing a value.
 *
 * The component owns a local model `m`, seeded from svc.section('basic', …) and
 * re-hydrated once svc.load() resolves; every edit writes the whole slice back
 * with svc.patch('basic', …). It never fetches or PUTs resume-profile itself.
