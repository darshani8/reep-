# =============================================================================
# SUPERSEDED AS THE STUDENT-FACING ASSISTANT — 2026-08. RETAINED FOR ROLLBACK.
#
# The student-facing assistant is now the realtime mock interviewer in
# app/routers/interview.py: a WebSocket relay between the student's browser and
# the OpenAI Realtime API, documented in docs/interview-assistant.md. The
# Angular assistant screen no longer opens a text chat against this module.
#
# NOTHING HAS BEEN DELETED. This file stays mounted and working, as do
# app/ai/orchestrator.py, app/assistant_tools.py, app/knowledge.py,
# app/ai/llm.py and app/eval/. Rolling back is re-pointing the client at
# /api/agent/ask — no code has to be restored from git. Deleting the old path
# in the same change that introduces its replacement is how a rollback stops
# being possible; do not tidy this away until the interviewer has held up in
# front of real students.
#
# SUPERSEDED entry points — still mounted, still functional, no UI caller:
#   POST   /api/agent/ask              was the primary path; replaced by the
#                                      interview WebSocket
#   POST   /api/agent/chat             no UI caller before or after; still the
#                                      subject of tests/test_conversations.py
#   POST   /api/agent/chat/stream      no caller before or after (SSE, dead)
#   GET    /api/agent/runs             no caller before or after
#   GET    /api/agent/knowledge/search test-only (tests/test_knowledge.py); the
#                                      orchestrator calls knowledge.search()
#                                      directly, not this HTTP route
#
# STILL LIVE — do NOT retire these along with the ones above:
#   GET    /api/agent/history          the transcript read for the assistant
#                                      screen. Interview turns are persisted
#                                      through app/conversations.py into the
#                                      SAME conversations/messages tables, and
#                                      conversations.history() filters on
#                                      is_final only — never on channel — so
#                                      this endpoint returns interview turns
#                                      unchanged, exactly as it already did for
#                                      LiveKit voice turns. One memory bank.
#   DELETE /api/agent/conversation     the only way a student clears the thread
#                                      the interviewer writes into (204).
#   POST   /api/agent/feedback         live, but CONDITIONAL: it 404s unless an
#                                      agent_runs row exists whose actor_id is
#                                      the caller, and the client only ever
#                                      learns a run_id from AskOut.run_id. The
#                                      interview path writes no AgentRun rows,
#                                      so on a student account it 404s on every
#                                      request and the thumbs-up/down UI simply
#                                      stops rendering (it is gated on
#                                      `turn.structured?.run_id`) — no console
#                                      error, no failing build. That 404 is now
#                                      a TOMBSTONE: when the caller owns no runs
#                                      at all it says why, so a log full of them
#                                      reads as a retirement, not a fault. Still
#                                      404, still indistinguishable from
#                                      "not yours" — see the handler.
#   GET    /api/agent/metrics          live (DIRECTOR/ADMIN, 403 otherwise). It
#                                      never errors, but every AgentRun-derived
#                                      counter froze when runs stopped being
#                                      written. The payload now SAYS so
#                                      (`agent_runs.collected` + the
#                                      `last_run_at` that dates the freeze)
#                                      instead of reporting a bare 0, and
#                                      `turns_by_channel` off Message.channel —
#                                      voice AND interview — is the live source
#                                      beside the feedback counts.
#
# The module docstring below predates /ask, /knowledge/search, /feedback and
# /metrics and lists only five of the nine routes. It is kept verbatim rather
# than rewritten, so what this module was on the day it was superseded is still
# legible.
# =============================================================================

"""Text chat with a SERVER-OWNED, persistent conversation.

The conversation is ALWAYS derived from the authenticated session — the client
never sends a session_id or conversation_id for writing or for deciding whose
history to read. This closes the P0 where a client-chosen `assistant-${userId}`
let a signed-in user read/write another user's thread.

  POST   /api/agent/chat          { message } -> { reply, conversation_id, model }
  POST   /api/agent/chat/stream   { message } -> SSE (same server-owned conversation)
  GET    /api/agent/history       -> { conversation_id, turns } for the CALLER
  DELETE /api/agent/conversation  -> soft-clears the caller's conversation, 204
  GET    /api/agent/runs          -> the caller's recent audit rows

The LLM goes through the universal adapter (app/ai/llm.py). The egress gate still
applies: this is a general conversational assistant, so `carries_student_data`
stays False; wire it True on any path that injects a student's private records.
Provider/exception detail is logged server-side and NEVER surfaced to the client.

    TWO SOURCES, AND THE PAYLOAD SAYS WHICH IS WHICH. Every AgentRun-derived
    number froze when the realtime interviewer replaced the /api/agent/ask
    assistant screen — the relay persists turns through app/conversations.py and
    writes no runs — so a flat 0 here reads as an outage when it is a retired
    collector. `agent_runs` carries that verdict explicitly (`collected`, plus the
    `last_run_at` that dates the freeze), and `turns_by_channel` off Message.channel
    is the source that is still live: it is the same grouping AGENTS.md's voice
    runbook query uses, so "did the interview save anything" is answerable from
    this endpoint too. `total_runs` and the two rates keep their exact meaning —
    nothing that was already pinned has been redefined.

    NOTE: TTFT (time-to-first-token) is a STREAMING-path metric; /ask is
