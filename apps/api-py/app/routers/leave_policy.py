The TABLES are `app/models/leave_policy.py`; the READING of them on the submit
path is `app/leave_policy.py` (`submit_refusal`, `academic_year_for`,
`working_days`). This module is the third piece: the CRUD, in its own router for
`app/routers/leave_paper.py`'s reason — `routers/leave.py` holds the form's
submit and decide paths, which the owner asked to leave exactly as they are.

==============================================================================
THE WRITES ARE THE MAIN ADMIN'S, AND NO NEW CAPABILITY KEY IS MINTED
==============================================================================

`require_admin` and nothing else. An allowance is the office recording what a
person is entitled to, and the calendar is the college recording when it is
shut; both are the office's own decisions and neither is a screen anybody has
asked to delegate. A new `admin.leave_policy` key would have to be added to
`CAPABILITIES`, enforced in the same commit, kept in `COLLEGE_ADMIN_CAPABILITIES`
or deliberately out of it, and answered for in Governance — all to express
"the Main Admin", which the role gate already says. Keys are cheap to add and
permanent to live with.

`mentor.leave_approve` is not asked for either, and that is not an oversight:
this module's one APPROVER-facing read (`/leaves/{id}/balance`) hangs off a
LEAVE REQUEST and is therefore gated by `_assert_can_decide` — the same three
doors, the same flattened 404, the same import that `leave_paper.py` takes.

==============================================================================
A BALANCE READ ABOUT SOMEBODY ELSE IS RULE 2, AND THE OBVIOUS FENCE IS A NO-OP
==============================================================================

`leave_balances` is keyed on `users` and INCLUDES STUDENTS, so "how many days
has this person taken" is a fact about a person that rule 2 governs. There is no
`require_capability(db, session, "mentor.leave_approve", target=...)` in this
file and there must not be one: that function SHORT-CIRCUITS before it looks at
a scope for a baseline key and for a capability a MENTOR holds as a derived
FUNCTION, and `mentor.leave_approve` is exactly such a function for every
faculty account that currently mentors anybody. Written that way the fence would
pass for most of the people it fences — `routers/leave.py::_holds_scoped_leave_grant`
carries the long version of this warning and `tests/test_leave_chain.py` pins
the difference.

So there are exactly two doors to somebody else's balance, and both already
exist: the Main Admin (the whole roster, through `require_admin`), and an
approver reading the balance OF A REQUEST THEY MAY DECIDE. A general
"show me any person's balance" endpoint for approvers is deliberately NOT built;
it would need either a fourth copy of rule 2 or the short-circuiting check
above, and neither is worth a screen nobody has drawn.

==============================================================================
THE CALENDAR IS A COLLEGE CATALOGUE AND NAMES NOBODY
==============================================================================

`GET /api/leaves/calendar` answers any signed-in account, for THEIR OWN college
only — it is the list of days the college is shut, which is public in every
sense that matters and is the number the submit path counts with. No rule-2 gate
applies because there is no person in it. Writing it is still the office's.

RULE 1 is not in play: nothing here reaches a model.
