"""B6.1 and B6.4 — the college's interview policy, and the two cap ceilings.

WHAT THIS MODULE IS FOR. Until now the three storage scopes were the STUDENT's,
ticked on a panel, and two of them were recorded and read by nothing at all;
the caps were one number in `app/config.py` for the whole deployment. B6.1 makes
the scopes the college's and B6.4 makes the caps theirs, and the risk in both is
the same: a policy that is WRITTEN but not ENFORCED is exactly the class of bug
`check_capability_enforcement.py` and B2.2's feature switches exist to stop —
a screen that says a rule is in force while nothing asks about it.

So almost every test here reaches past the payload to the thing that acts on it:
the socket's own `_open_records`, the turn writer, `recorder_for`, the
heartbeat. The HTTP tests check the fences (capability, scope, reason, bounds);
the rest check that the numbers actually decide something.

THREE PROPERTIES THAT MUST NOT BE WEAKENED, and each has a test whose name says
so:

  * a policy row must not be needed. A deployment that never opens the policy
    screen has to behave exactly as it did before this table existed, because
    that is the compatibility rule and because the console's "not configured"
    state has to be reachable.
  * counting completions only must not remove the spend ceiling. The comment
    `_open_records` has carried since the cap was written is the argument, and
    B6.4 would have deleted the control it describes.
  * consent still fails CLOSED on open and OPEN mid-interview, and the scopes
    are still THREE booleans on a row that an interview pins by id.
