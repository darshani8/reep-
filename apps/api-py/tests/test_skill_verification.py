"""Student -> mentor skill verification: the decision, and what it tells people.

Three rules are pinned here, and each exists because breaking it is SILENT — the
endpoint still returns 200, the screen still renders, and the damage shows up as
a student who does not know what to do next, or a resume that overstates.

  * NEEDS_CHANGES and REJECTED are different outcomes. One means "redo this",
    the other "this will not be granted", and the student sees a status and a
    note and nothing else. Collapsing them back into one status is the easiest
    regression to make here and the hardest to notice.
  * A non-approval requires a note, in the API and not only in the form. A
    rejection a student cannot act on is indistinguishable, from their side,
    from a bug.
  * A generated resume lists VERIFIED skills only. An unverified StudentSkill is
    a claim still with a mentor; printing it under Skills presents work in
    review as work confirmed, which is the thing this whole flow exists to
    prevent.

All @requires_db: real users, a real claim and a real decision. The behaviour
lives in the endpoints, so testing the pure functions underneath would prove
much less.
