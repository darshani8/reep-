"""B1.4 / B1.5 — the lists a scoped grant may read, and who may mentor whom.

B1.2 gave a grant a scope and taught `require_capability` to check it for ONE
record. Every list in the console still selected every row on the deployment, so
a grant scoped to one department was a fence around the single-record endpoints
with an open gate beside it: the roster, the review queue, the SWOC board, the
analytics tiles and the mentor map all answered in full to a holder who could
not open any one of their rows.

What each of these tests holds down, and what comes back if it is deleted:

1. EVERY SCOPED LIST IS NARROWED BY THE SAME REACH. Delete
   `test_a_scoped_holder_sees_only_their_reach` and a department-scoped
   `admin.students` grant reads the other department's roster — names,
   addresses and USNs — on the screen that has an Edit button beside each row.
2. THE BUTTON OBEYS THE LIST. Delete `test_the_edit_is_narrowed_by_the_same_grant`
   or `test_a_scoped_reviewer_cannot_decide_an_application_outside_their_reach`
   and the narrowing becomes decoration: a caller who cannot see a record can
   still change it by typing the id, and for registrations that means minting a
   `users` row, which IS the access control.
3. THE MAIN ADMIN IS NOT NARROWED. Delete `test_the_main_admin_is_not_narrowed`
   and the fix above becomes an empty console for the account that holds every
   capability — a screen that reads as data loss rather than as a permission
   bug.
4. A DERIVED FUNCTION IS NOT A SCOPED GRANT. Delete
   `test_a_faculty_approver_keeps_their_queue` and the two staff queues that
   compose a scope with a mentor-group fence empty themselves for every faculty
   member on the deployment, because `scope_filter` reports `nothing` for a
   capability held as a function.
5. A MENTOR IS IN THE STUDENT'S COLLEGE. Delete
   `test_a_mentor_from_another_college_is_refused` and rule 2 becomes a thing
   the assignment screen can edit across tenants.
6. EXISTING PAIRS ARE KEPT AND FLAGGED. Delete
   `test_an_existing_cross_department_pair_is_kept_and_flagged` and the
   acceptance criterion goes with it: the office meets B1.5 as mentors losing
   their mentees rather than as a policy taking effect.
