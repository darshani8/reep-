"""One device at a time: a REEP account holds exactly one live session.

THE RULE. Signing in anywhere signs the account out everywhere else. The newest
sign-in wins and the older device is dropped on its next request. There is no
sessions table and no device list — every sign-in advances `users.token_version`,
and app/security.py already refuses a token whose version is behind the row.

WHY IT NEEDS TESTS OF ITS OWN. The mechanism is invisible from the outside: a
sign-in that forgets to advance the version issues a perfectly good session, the
student sees nothing wrong, every other test stays green, and the account
quietly holds two live devices again. The only way to see it is to hold two
cookies and check the older one is dead — which is exactly what a normal test
never does, because a normal test uses one.

FOUR DOORS, and the rule has to hold on all of them or it holds on none: the
password door, the emailed-code door, the Google door, and the activation link
that signs a new staff account in. A student who wants two devices only needs to
find the one door that forgot.

The negative case matters as much: the session a sign-in has just minted must
not be caught by its own retirement. That would be a login endpoint returning
200 with a cookie that 401s on the very next request.
