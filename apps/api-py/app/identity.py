    Two things force this to be a sibling rather than a reuse of the function
    above, and both fail SILENTLY if ignored:

      * The parameter must be annotated `WebSocket`, not `Request`. FastAPI
        fills a Request-annotated parameter only when the connection IS a
        Request (fastapi/dependencies/utils.py), so on a websocket scope the
        argument is never supplied and the dependency raises TypeError before
        the handshake completes — the browser gets a failed connection with no
        close code at all.
      * HTTPException is routed to FastAPI's http_exception_handler, which
        emits `http.response.start` — illegal on a websocket scope.
        WebSocketException is the only exception the exception middleware can
        serve here, and 1008 is the code FastAPI's own WS validation handler
        uses.

    Callers that want the browser to learn WHY should accept the socket first
    and call this explicitly, catching WebSocketException: a close sent before
    accept fails the HTTP upgrade, and the browser WebSocket API surfaces
    neither code nor reason for that. See app/routers/interview.py.
