# Student: home and progress

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Screens | `/student`, `/student/skilling`, `/student/time-log`, `/student/courses`, `/student/records`, `/student/leaderboards` |
| Automated tests | [`tests/03-student-progress.spec.ts`](../../tests/03-student-progress.spec.ts) |
| ID range | TC-200 to TC-299 |

Setup, the seeded accounts and the rules that link these cases to their
automated tests are in [the index](../manual-test-cases.md).

Every case here is run as the dev seed's student, Test Student
(`student@bgscet.ac.in` / `student123`, USN `1BG24MBA001`), signed in as in
TC-001 unless the case says otherwise. "Today" on the Time Allocation Ledger
is the programme's calendar day, which the server decides in the college's
time zone (`PROGRAMME_TIMEZONE`, Asia/Kolkata by default), not the tester's
computer clock.

## TC-213 — Filing a claim with a certificate sends the badge to the mentor

| Field | Value |

| Module | Skilling: claim form |
| Priority | P1 |
| Type | Functional, positive |
| Automated test | `tests/03-student-progress.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-213` |

### Pre-conditions

1. The dev seed has been applied, so the student has a mentor (Test Mentor).
2. The browser is signed in as the seeded student.
3. "Design Thinking" reads "Not claimed" on the board: no claim of it is
   waiting for the mentor.
4. The student has fewer than 40 uploaded files, the per-student limit.

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Certificate | `tests/fixtures/sample.pdf` (a one-page PDF) |
| Skill category | Thinking Skills |
| Skill badge | Design Thinking |
| Issued by | `E2E Institute` and a run id, e.g. `E2E Institute k3x9a` |
| Note for your mentor | `E2E claim` and the same run id |

### Steps

1. Open the Skilling screen at `/student/skilling`.
2. Click "Click to upload or drop a file" and choose the certificate file.
3. In "Skill category", select Thinking Skills.
4. In "Skill badge", select Design Thinking.
5. Enter the test data in "Issued by" and "Note for your mentor".
6. Click Submit claim.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 2 | The upload box is replaced by the file name, "sample.pdf", and a Replace button. Submit claim stays disabled. |
| ER-2 | 4 | Submit claim becomes enabled. |
| ER-3 | 6 | The form is replaced by "Claim submitted. Your mentor will review the certificate and verify the badge within two working days." and a "Claim another skill" button. |
| ER-4 | 6 | The "Design Thinking" badge now reads "With your mentor", and "Claims in progress" lists "Design Thinking" with the status "With your mentor" and the note "—". |
| ER-5 | 6 | **Manual only.** The claim waits in Test Mentor's queue at `/mentor/verifications` (module 05), and the certificate is on the student's `/student/uploads` shelf, titled "Design Thinking — " followed by the issuer. Where mail is on for skill claims (`BADGE_MAIL_ENABLED=true`, or SES configured), Test Mentor is emailed "Test Student has claimed the Design Thinking badge". |

### Post-conditions

The claim waits for the mentor, and the badge reads "With your mentor",
until the mentor decides it. To run the case again, the mentor rejects the
claim with a note on `/mentor/verifications`, and the student deletes the
certificate on `/student/uploads`. The automated test does both through the
API when it ends. The rejected claim stays in "Claims in progress" as
"Design Thinking", "Not verified", with the note "E2E cleanup: rejected by
the automated run.", and the badge reads "Not claimed" again.

### Steps

1. Open the Skilling screen at `/student/skilling`.
2. Click "Click to upload or drop a file" and choose the PNG file.
3. Click "Click to upload or drop a file" and choose the PDF larger than 5 MB.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 2 | An error reads "That file is not a PDF or a JPEG. Attach the certificate as one of those." No file is attached: the box still reads "Click to upload or drop a file", and there is no Replace button. |
| ER-2 | 3 | The error changes to "That file is over 5 MB. Export a smaller PDF or JPEG and try again." and still no file is attached. |

### Pre-conditions

1. The dev seed has been applied. It writes a submitted day for the day
   before it ran and a 23.5-hour draft for the day it ran.
2. The browser is signed in as the seeded student.

### Test data

None beyond the seeded student.

### Steps

1. Open the Time Allocation Ledger at `/student/time-log`.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 1 | The page is headed "Time Allocation Ledger" under the eyebrow "Daily log · Semester 2". The date control shows today in the form "Wed · 23 Sep 2026", and Next day is disabled. |
| ER-2 | 1 | A "Last 14 days" card lists 14 day chips, today first, labelled "Today" and then by weekday and date. Each chip says what the day holds: "Submitted", "Draft · N h" (saved but not submitted), "Not logged", "Locked" (past its edit window with nothing logged) or "N h · locked". On the day the seed ran, the day before it reads "Submitted" and the seed's own day "Draft · 23.5 h". |
| ER-3 | 1 | The card's summary counts the submitted days and the days with any hours, "N submitted · M with entries", and says "Each day can be filled in for 2 days after it ends, then it locks." |
| ER-4 | 1 | The table has six slot rows, "5:00 – 9:00 am" (4 h capacity), "9:00 am – 12:00 pm" (3 h), "12:00 – 3:00 pm" (3 h), "3:00 – 6:00 pm" (3 h), "6:00 – 10:00 pm" (4 h) and "10:00 pm – 5:00 am" (7 h), and five activity columns, Sleep, Travel / personal, Lectures, Coursework and Skilling. Four tiles above it read Day accounted, Productive, Waking utilisation and Rest, and Day accounted shows today's logged hours "/ 24 h". |

| Type | Functional, regression |
| Automated test | `tests/03-student-progress.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-221` |

Each click loads its day, and the screen draws only the day clicked last,
whatever order the loads finish in: click Next day twice quickly from the
day before yesterday and the screen settles on today, with Next day
disabled, even when yesterday's answer arrives after today's. The same holds
for the buttons that write: Submit day submits the day it was pressed on, and
a step taken while it is still saving leaves that day a saved draft and
submits nothing. The steps below wait for each day, as a person does; the
answers arriving out of order are covered by the unit tests in
`apps/web/src/app/features/student/ledger/ledger.component.spec.ts`.

### Pre-conditions

1. The dev seed has been applied.
2. The browser is signed in as the seeded student.
3. Worth running from a browser set to an Indian time zone as well: the
   stepper once skipped two days back and could not move forward there.
4. Wait for each day's hours to load before the next click.

### Test data

None beyond the seeded student.

### Steps

1. Open the Time Allocation Ledger at `/student/time-log`.
2. Click Previous day.
3. Click Previous day again.
4. Click Next day.
5. Click Next day again.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 2 | The date control shows yesterday, yesterday's chip in the "Last 14 days" strip is highlighted as the day on screen, and Next day becomes enabled. |
| ER-2 | 3 | The date control shows the day before yesterday, and that day's chip is highlighted. |
| ER-3 | 4 | The date control shows yesterday again. |
| ER-4 | 5 | The date control shows today, the "Today" chip is highlighted, and Next day is disabled again, because a day that has not happened cannot be logged. |

### Pre-conditions

1. The dev seed has been applied.
2. The browser is signed in as the seeded student.
3. At least one day in the edit window (today and the 2 days before it) is
   neither submitted nor locked. Submitting cannot be undone (TC-228), so
   once all three are submitted this case waits for the next day. The
   automated run records it, and every ledger case that needs an open day,
   as Skipped until then, because used-up test data is not a broken
   environment. A freshly seeded database always has open days.

### Test data

| Slot | Activity | Hours |
|---|---|---|
| 10:00 pm – 5:00 am | Sleep | 7 |
| 9:00 am – 12:00 pm | Lectures | 3 |
| 12:00 – 3:00 pm | Coursework | 2 |
| 3:00 – 6:00 pm | Skilling | 1.5 |

Every other cell is left blank: 13.5 hours in all.

### Steps

1. Open the Time Allocation Ledger at `/student/time-log`.
2. In the "Last 14 days" strip, click the most recent day that is neither "Submitted" nor locked.
3. Enter the test data hours, leaving every other cell blank.
4. Click Save draft.
5. Reload the page and click the same day in the strip again.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 2 | The date control shows that day, its chip in the strip is highlighted, and a chip under the table reads "Open until" and the date two days after that day, e.g. "Open until Fri 25 Sep" for 23 Sep. |
| ER-2 | 3 | The Logged column follows the typing: "10:00 pm – 5:00 am" reads "7 /7" "Balanced", "9:00 am – 12:00 pm" "3 /3" "Balanced", "12:00 – 3:00 pm" "2 /3" "1 h open", "3:00 – 6:00 pm" "1.5 /3" "1.5 h open", and "5:00 – 9:00 am" "0 /4" "Empty". The Day total row reads "13.5 /24" and "10.5 h to reconcile". Save draft is enabled. |
| ER-3 | 4 | The tiles update: Day accounted "13.5" "/ 24 h" with "10.5 h to reconcile", and Productive "6.5" "h". Under the table a chip reads "10.5 h to reconcile before you can submit." The day's chip in the strip reads "Draft · 13.5 h". Save draft is disabled again. |
| ER-4 | 5 | The hours are still there: the four cells hold 7, 3, 2 and 1.5, and the Day total row reads "13.5 /24". |

### Post-conditions

The day holds the 13.5-hour draft. The automated test puts back the hours
the day had before. A day that had nothing logged is left as a saved draft
with no hours, whose chip reads "Draft · 0 h".

| ER-1 | 3 | The Day total row reads "23.5 /24" and "0.5 h to reconcile", the "3:00 – 6:00 pm" row reads "2.5 /3" "0.5 h open", and Submit day is disabled. |
| ER-2 | 4 | Day accounted reads "23.5" "/ 24 h" with "0.5 h to reconcile", a chip under the table reads "0.5 h to reconcile before you can submit.", and Submit day is still disabled. |
| ER-3 | 5 | The Day total row reads "24 /24" and "Reconciled", the "3:00 – 6:00 pm" row reads "3 /3" "Balanced", and Submit day becomes enabled. Do not click it: submitting cannot be undone (TC-228). |

### Post-conditions

The day holds the 23.5-hour draft saved in step 4. The automated test puts
back the hours the day had before.

## TC-225 — The weekly skilling strip adds up the Skilling hours logged this week

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-225 |
| Module | Time Allocation Ledger: weekly skilling |
| Priority | P2 |
| Type | Functional, positive |
| Automated test | `tests/03-student-progress.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-225` |

### Pre-conditions

1. The dev seed has been applied. The student's weekly skilling target is
   12 hours.
2. The browser is signed in as the seeded student.
3. At least one day in the edit window is neither submitted nor locked (see
   TC-222).

### Test data

| Slot | Activity | Hours |
|---|---|---|
| 5:00 – 9:00 am | Skilling | 4 |

Every other cell is left blank.

### Steps

1. Open the Time Allocation Ledger at `/student/time-log` and note the hours in "Skilling this week".
2. In the "Last 14 days" strip, click the most recent day that is neither "Submitted" nor locked.
3. Enter the test data hours, leaving every other cell blank.
4. Click Save draft.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 1 | Under the table, "Skilling this week · X h of a 12 h target" and a chip with X as a whole percentage of 12. X adds up the Skilling hours of today and the six days before it: a day's Skilling cells on the ledger, or, for a day with no hours on the ledger, its entries in the old time log. On the day the dev seed ran, X is 9.5 and the chip reads 79%. |
| ER-2 | 4 | X changes by exactly what the save changed: it loses the day's previous Skilling hours and gains 4. The chip shows the new X as a whole percentage of 12, capped at 100%. |

### Post-conditions

The day holds the 4-hour draft. The automated test puts back the hours the
day had before.

3. A day in the edit window is neither submitted nor locked, and the day
   before it is "Submitted". On the day the seed ran, the seed's own day
   qualifies. The automated test submits an earlier open day through the API
   when no day qualifies.

### Test data

None beyond the seeded student.

### Steps

1. Open the Time Allocation Ledger at `/student/time-log`.
2. In the "Last 14 days" strip, click the most recent open day whose previous day reads "Submitted".
3. Click Copy yesterday.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 3 | Every cell takes the hours of the submitted day before it: the Day total row reads "24 /24" and "Reconciled", and Submit day is enabled. The copy does not submit the day: its chip reads "Draft · 24 h". |

### Post-conditions

The day holds the copied hours as a draft. The automated test puts back the
hours the day had before.

### Pre-conditions

1. The dev seed has been applied.
2. The browser is signed in as the seeded student.
3. At least one day in the edit window is neither submitted nor locked (see
   TC-222).

### Test data

The 24-hour day: the test data of TC-224 with 3 hours, not 2.5, under
Skilling in the "3:00 – 6:00 pm" row.

### Steps

1. Open the Time Allocation Ledger at `/student/time-log`.

3. Enter the test data hours, leaving every other cell blank.
4. Click Submit day.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 2 | The date control shows that day, and its chip in the strip is highlighted. |
| ER-2 | 3 | The Day total row reads "24 /24" and "Reconciled", every slot row reads "Balanced", and Submit day is enabled. |
| ER-3 | 4 | The button reads "Submitted" and is disabled, a chip under the table reads "Submitted — this day is closed", every hour cell is disabled, and Save draft is gone. |
| ER-4 | 4 | The day's chip in the strip reads "Submitted", and the strip's "N submitted" count is one higher than before. |

### Post-conditions

The day stays submitted for good: nothing in the product reopens a
submitted day. Each run uses up one of the at most three open days, so after
three runs in one day TC-222 to TC-228 wait for the next day, or a database
reset.

## TC-241 — A student with nothing imported sees "not recorded yet", never a zero

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-241 |
| Module | Records and student home: empty states |
| Priority | P2 |
| Type | Functional, negative |
| Automated test | None (manual only): it needs a student account with no imported marks, attendance or qualifications. The dev seed has one student, who has all three, and a new student can only get a password through the codes and links the onboarding walk emails. |
