# NOTE (2026-08): the student-facing assistant is now the realtime mock
# interviewer in app/api/student/interview_session.py, and it calls NO tool in this
# module — by design. The Realtime session is a REMOTE provider, so no
# student record (marks, attendance, CGPA, USN, resume text) may enter its
# prompt, which is exactly what these tools return. They stay in place for
# the orchestrator behind POST /api/agent/ask (retained for rollback). Any
# future path that does feed a tool result to a model must go through
# complete_chat(..., carries_student_data=True) in app/ai/llm.py.
# See docs/interview-assistant.md.

"""Read-only STUDENT TOOLS for the grounded assistant.

These are the assistant orchestrator's *source of truth* for LIVE student facts.
Instead of guessing a student's numbers, the orchestrator calls a tool here and
gets exactly what the student sees on their own screens — because each tool runs
the SAME code path as the corresponding `/student/...` endpoint.

Design contract
---------------
* Every tool takes a live SQLAlchemy ``Session`` plus the caller's
  ``student_id`` and returns a plain ``dict`` / ``list`` (JSON-ready), never a
  Pydantic model or an ORM row.
* Business logic is NOT reproduced here. Each tool invokes the real endpoint
  function from ``app.api.student.self_service`` (with a minimal synthetic session) or a
  shared helper from that module, then projects the result down to the shape the
  orchestrator wants. If a screen's number changes, these tools change with it.
* These tools are read-only and student-scoped: they only ever return the
  caller's own facts, and they never send anything to a model. Grounding the
  assistant with them keeps live student data on this machine (AGENTS.md).

The one exception is :func:`profile_completion`, for which there is no single
endpoint; it is composed from the placement-profile fields and the resume-profile
completeness helper (``_resume_pct`` / ``_resume_completeness``) that the
readiness and next-actions endpoints already use.
