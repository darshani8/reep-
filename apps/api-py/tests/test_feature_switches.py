"""B2.2 — the student feature switches decide something.

Between 2026-08 and this module the ten switches on the Governance screen were
recorded, audited, shown with a reason and a target count, and INERT:
`governance.feature_enabled()` and `features_for()` were written, correct and
covered by `tests/test_governance.py`, and nothing called either. The office
could switch the mock interviewer off for a whole cohort and watch that cohort
use it all afternoon. A switch wired to nothing is worse than a missing one,
because somebody trusted it.

What is pinned here is therefore not the resolution — `test_governance.py` owns
that — but the three things that make a switch REAL:

  * the routers ask (every feature, at its own screen, with the office's own
    words in the refusal);
  * `GET /api/auth/me` tells a student's client which of them are off, so the
    nav can grey the item instead of letting them walk into a 403;
  * the catalogue admits which keys are enforced, and `PUT /features` REFUSES
    to set one that is not — the console must never offer a switch that does
    nothing, which is the state this task ended.
