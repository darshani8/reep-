"""Interview audio capture — the four objections v3 §8.4 raised, as tests.

§8.4 said "do not implement byte capture in this pass" and gave four reasons.
The product owner has since required a stored recording for authorised developer
review, so capture exists — and every test below is one of those objections
turned into something that fails if the answer stops holding:

  1. "No encoder."            -> test_the_file_is_a_playable_wav_and_its_duration_matches_the_bytes
  2. "48 kB/s, no quota."     -> TestTheCap, and test_retention_can_delete_by_session_id_alone
  3. "document_store can't be it." -> TestNames (its hardening, carried over, in a store of our own)
  4. "Voice is biometric."    -> TestTheTwoGates — no flag, no bytes; no consent, no bytes

Its FIFTH objection — that the two tracks are not time-aligned, so mixing them
would invent a fact — was upheld for a year and then answered rather than
overruled: TestTheTimeline pins the wall-clock padding that makes the two files
line up, and only then does TestTheMixdown assert that the single-file listening
copy built from them puts each speaker where they actually spoke. Read those two
in that order; the second is meaningless without the first.

Most of it needs no database and no socket. The consent gate and the download
endpoint do, and those are @requires_db.

EVERY TEST WRITES INTO tmp_path. The `store` fixture repoints the store root, so
a failing run cannot leave a WAV file in the developer's real var/ directory —
which for this feature would be somebody's actual voice.
