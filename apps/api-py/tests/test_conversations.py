"""Assistant V2 Phase A — conversation OWNERSHIP + lifecycle.

The security spine of the assistant: a conversation belongs to exactly one user
and is ALWAYS resolved from the authenticated session. The endpoints accept NO
conversation/session id, so cross-user access is impossible by construction —
these tests pin that contract end-to-end (via TestClient) and unit-test the
`assert_owner` guard in app/assistant/conversations.py directly.

The chat endpoint would otherwise call a live LLM; `stub_llm` monkeypatches the
router's `llm_config`/`complete_chat` so the flow is deterministic and offline.
Every row a test creates (users, students, conversations, messages, agent-runs)
is cleaned up, so the suite stays independent and re-runnable.
