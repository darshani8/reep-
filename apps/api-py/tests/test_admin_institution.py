"""The Main Admin institutional write layer: `app/routers/admin.py`.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `admin.py` shipped with 11 operations, no tests and no
frontend caller. Three independent reviews of the institutional spine put the
same item at the top of all three lists, and one of them found a live 500 in
three of the endpoints just by reading them — a cleared form field sends
`{"name": null}`, which `exclude_unset` keeps and `setattr` then writes to a NOT
NULL column. Eleven `require_admin` calls, none of them proven to run before
the work happens, is not a surface anyone should deploy.

WHAT IT PINS, in the order the reviewers ranked the danger:

  * Every operation refuses a non-director. Rule 2 says scope is decided by
    role; that only holds if the check is reached.
  * `{"name": null}` is a 422 and not an IntegrityError-shaped 500.
  * Seating a student changes THAT student's card and nobody else's.
  * `department_id` has a writer, and cohorts that have no department are
    reachable — without both, every cohort predating this feature is stranded
    where the console cannot see or fix it.
  * The uniqueness rules are the ones intended: college code global, department
    code per-college, so two colleges may each run a "CSE".
