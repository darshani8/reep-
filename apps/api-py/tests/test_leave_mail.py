"""B10.5 — leave notifications, and the fact that they ship OFF.

Four things, and the first is the one that matters most.

1. OFF BY DEFAULT — the DEFAULT, which is not the same as the deployment. B3.7
   shipped on 2026-09-15 and production now sets `LEAVE_MAIL_ENABLED=true` from
   the task definition over a verified SES identity. What the default protects
   is a machine WITHOUT a transport: with `SES_FROM_ADDRESS` blank, which is
   every development box and every run of this suite, `mail_transport.send`
   logs the message into a bounded in-memory `outbox` that reaches NOBODY, so a
   notification switched on there writes a `mail_logs` row reading SENT for a
   message the applicant never received — and that row is the only thing anyone
   looks at afterwards. It is the shape of the failure that killed
   `PENDING_VERIFICATION`, and `test_it_is_off_by_default` is what keeps the
   default honest. No screen may say "the applicant has been emailed" while it
   is false.
2. THE `reason` NEVER TRAVELS. It is the form's "Purpose" cell — free text,
   routinely medical, the whole subject of rule 2's fence over this area. The
   tests below search the entire outbound message, subject and body, for the
   applicant's own sentence.
3. EXACTLY ONCE PER TRANSITION. These fire on state changes that can be retried;
   `mailer.deliver_once` is the arbiter and the key is `leave:{id}:{status}` —
   stable per transition, different per transition. Keyed on the request alone
   the sanction mail would be silent because the submission mail had gone.
4. NOT EVERY STATUS IS NOTIFIED. A CANCELLED request sends nothing: the
   applicant withdrew it themselves and does not need to be told what they just
   did.

# THE WIRING (stage 4). The module above is correct and was, until this, called
# by nothing: `notify_transition`'s three call sites are all inside
# `app/routers/leave.py`, which stage 3 was told to leave alone. These two tests
# are behavioural on purpose — they drive the real endpoints rather than
# asserting that a line exists — because "is B10.5 reachable" is a question
# about the call graph and an import is not an answer to it.
#
# NEITHER ENDPOINT CHANGED SHAPE. `notify_transition` returns None when the flag
# is off (every deployment), never raises, and is called AFTER the commit, so
# the 201 and the 200 are byte for byte what they were. The default-off case is
# covered by `test_it_is_off_by_default_and_writes_nothing` above; these two
# turn it on to prove the wire is there at all.
