"""Promotion and graduation — `app/routers/admin_promotion.py` (B4.2-B4.4).

WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR, in the order the danger runs:

  1. **Nothing is rewritten by a promotion.** Four tables carry a semester
     number and exactly one of them is the student's current position. The
     guard test snapshots every one of the other three around a real promotion
     and demands they come back byte-identical. It is the test the phase prompt
     asks for by name, and it is the one that would catch the "helpful" edit
     that walks `semester_results` forward with the student.

  2. **A graduate is refused `/api/student/*`.** Graduation flips `users.role`
     to ALUMNI and KEEPS the `students` row, so `session["studentId"]` survives
     it — and `_require_student` read only that claim. Every student endpoint
     would have stayed open behind an Angular guard that closed the screens. The
     test signs the graduate back in and knocks on four of those doors.

  3. **The semester bound is the course's, not a flat eight** (B4.2), including
     the fallback for a batch that names no course, and the error SHAPE: the
     check moved from a Pydantic `Field(le=…)` (detail is a LIST) to a handler
     `HTTPException` (detail is a STRING), and the console renders both through
     `detailOf`.

  4. The dry run reports before it applies, attendance is reported
     `unavailable` rather than invented, and the reversal window closes.

FIXTURES are borrowed by name from test_admin_institution (`chain`, `director`,
`tracker`, `_code`), the same way test_admin_students borrows them: the College
-> Department -> Batch chain is built THROUGH THE API, so the fixture itself
fails if the console cannot do this.
