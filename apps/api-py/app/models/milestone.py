"""Programme milestones — the three stage cards on the student landing screen.

THE CATALOGUE IS CODE; ONLY THE STATUS IS A ROW. Reboot / Excel / Elevate and
their items are the programme's structure, identical for every student in the
cohort, and changing it is a decision the placement office makes once — not
per-student data. Seeding fourteen rows per student to say "not started yet"
would put the programme's shape in the database in fourteen thousand places,
where a rename becomes a migration and a half-run migration becomes a cohort
whose landing screens disagree with each other.

So `MILESTONES` below is the structure, and `student_milestones` holds a row
only where a student has actually moved off the default. Absent means
NOT_STARTED, which is what a student who has just enrolled genuinely is.

One item is special: `english_baseline` is a LINK, not a checkbox — its row on
the Reboot card navigates to the English Baseline screen, and its status is
derived from the attempt rather than stored here. `derived_from` marks it so the
router knows not to trust a stored row for that key.
