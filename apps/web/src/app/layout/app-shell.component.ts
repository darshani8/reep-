/**
 * The authenticated frame every role screen sits in — the 2026-09 shell.
 *
 * A 52px app bar, a 220px sidebar of grouped pill items, and a scrolling main
 * area the child route renders into. The navigation switches on the session's
 * role: students get the student items with their identity card on top, staff
 * get the faculty pages, the Main Admin gets the console in plain words (Home
 * first), alumni get profile and jobs.
 *
 * Every visual token lives globally in src/styles/reep-v2.scss — AGENTS.md's
 * rule is that the design system is global CSS classes and a component does not
 * redefine them. This file owns only the frame's behaviour: who is signed in,
 * which links they get, and the account menu.
 *
 * THE NAVIGATION IS DATA, NOT MARKUP. It was five hand-written blocks of
 * anchors; the console's six groups would have made it six. One model, one
 * loop, and the two things that are easy to get wrong become properties you
 * can see: whether an item needs a capability, and whether its screen exists
 * yet.
 *
 * A SCREEN THAT IS NOT BUILT IS NOT A LINK. Angular's wildcard sends an
 * unmatched path through homeRedirectGuard back to /admin, so a `routerLink`
 * to a screen that does not exist would look live, do nothing, and read as a
 * broken console. An item with `path: null` renders instead as a disabled row
 * carrying the phase it arrives in — the same rule 06-phase-prompts.md sets
 * for Phase 2's plan-driven controls: never a dead control that looks live.
 * Phase 2 builds every admin screen on the boards, so no row is pending today;
 * the mechanism stays because the next unbuilt screen must not become a
 * routerLink to nowhere.

 * clerk knows. Same eighteen screens as before, plus Home and Placement:
 * Placement was reachable only from the Jobs sheet's buttons, which for the
