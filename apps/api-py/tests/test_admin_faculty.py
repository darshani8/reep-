"""Faculty accounts created by the Main Admin on screen.

Pinned: only the Main Admin may create one (DIRECTOR, MENTOR and STUDENT are
refused by name); the account is a MENTOR with no password and no group; an
address already in use is refused; and the activation link the screen shows
really works - redeemed with a password, the new faculty member signs in on
the password door and holds their own account.
