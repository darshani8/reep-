"""The programme sign-up flow (ported from Prisma): an application to join,
the data-driven rules that may wave it through, and single-use email
confirmation links.

Structural note carried over verbatim: `Registration` has NO foreign key to
`Student`. A Student cannot exist until a cohort is decided — which is the very
thing approval decides — so the applicant lives in its own table until then, and
the created student's id is written back to `approved_student_id` as a plain
string breadcrumb (deleting the student must not resurrect a pending application).

`registration_status` is a new PG enum; `degree_level` is the existing one shared
with Cohort/Job (create_type=False), reused by one instance across both columns
that need it here.
