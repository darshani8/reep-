"""One Main Admin: the account tool mints it once and never a DIRECTOR.

`python -m app.grant_access` is the only way a staff account is created on a
production host (the seed refuses there). Pinned here: while an office account
exists, granting ADMIN to a DIFFERENT address is refused and the message names
the account that holds it; DIRECTOR is refused outright; re-running for the
Main Admin's own address is the idempotent update the module promises; and
faculty are MENTOR, which still works exactly as before.
