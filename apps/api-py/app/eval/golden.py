"""Golden-set for the tool-backed assistant (Assistant V2 Phase D).

A small, hand-written regression suite that pins the CONTRACT of
``orchestrator.answer_question`` — not a provider's wording. Each case fixes:

* ``expect_intent``     — the intent the rule router must land on.
* ``expect_resolved``   — the grounding signal for grounded cases (True), OR
* ``expect_refusal``    — True for a case that must honestly NOT be grounded
                          (out-of-scope / unknown), i.e. ``resolved is False``.
* ``expect_source_type``— (optional) the source type the answer must cite:
                          ``student-record`` for a personal tool, ``policy`` for
                          an approved knowledge chunk.

The set covers every student-data intent (readiness, gaps, skills, eligible jobs,
deadlines, profile completion), the policy / FAQ path, and honest refusal on
questions the assistant has no grounded answer for. ``tests/test_assistant_eval.py``
runs each case against the real orchestrator and asserts these fields hold, then
prints the pass rate — a real regression gate, not a smoke test.
