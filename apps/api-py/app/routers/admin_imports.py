"""Spreadsheet imports — the history, and the gate the rest of B8.1 lands on.

    GET /admin/imports        the runs this session may see, newest first

ITS OWN MODULE, mounted under the same `/admin` prefix as `admin_students.py`,
`admin_promotion.py` and `admin_faculty.py`: the house precedent for a new admin
surface, and the two files that would otherwise have grown (`console.py` and
`admin.py`) are ~1700 lines each. The client sees one flat surface.

ALL FIVE ENDPOINTS ARE HERE NOW — preview, apply, the history, the error report
and the file templates. The history landed first with the schema, because a
capability key with no call site is a promise the API does not keep
(`app/models/governance.py`, and `tools/ci/check_capability_enforcement.py`
fails the build over it); the other four needed the parser
(`app/imports_sheet.py`) and land with it.

PREVIEW WRITES, AND WHAT IT WRITES IS NOT A STUDENT RECORD. 04-backend-changes.md
says the preview changes nothing, and that is exactly true of the data the
office cares about: not one row of `attendance_records`, `semester_results` or
`subject_marks` is touched until somebody presses Import rows. The run and its
parsed lines ARE written, because they have to be — `apply` takes a `run_id` and
reads the judged lines back rather than re-parsing a file nobody kept, which is
what makes "the rows I reviewed are the rows that were written" true. A preview
nobody applies is a `previewed` run with `rows_applied = 0`, which is the
resting state of a file somebody read and thought better of.

THE PARSE IS ON THE SERVER AND MUST STAY THERE. The screen's header comment says
why from the other side: a browser that read the spreadsheet itself would draw
rows under a Check column that no validator ever saw. Every verdict in the
preview response was reached against this batch's roster, this course's semester
count and this deployment's subject catalogue.

THE SCOPE, AND WHY IT IS NOT `reach.student_ids()`. An import run names a BATCH,
not a student: `app/scope_views.py::import_run_scope_clause` is the projection
of one reach onto `import_runs`, written there beside the registrations one for
the same reason — a run, like an application, is not a `students` row and the
model that does not belong to `policies.py` should not be taught to it.

RULE 2 IS NOT IN PLAY ON THE HISTORY LIST AND IS ON EVERY OTHER ENDPOINT HERE.
A run row is a filename, a batch, five counts and a date; it names no student.
The preview, the apply and the error report name every student in the file, one
line each, so all three take `require_capability(..., target=...)` against the
BATCH'S ancestry (`governance.ancestry_of_cohort`) as well as this key — and the
batch rather than the students, because the batch a new cohort's first results
file is imported into has nobody seated in it yet, and a fence that walked the
students would find none and refuse the office.

    rows are written, numbered 1..30, the first 26 present. That is not a
