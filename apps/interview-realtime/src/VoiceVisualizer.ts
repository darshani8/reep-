 * VoiceVisualizer — a fluid, morphing, audio-reactive voice orb on native Canvas 2D.

 * Zero imports. Zero libraries. Everything — the noise field, the spline, the damping,
 * the overlay CSS — is implemented in this file.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE MATHEMATICS, IN ONE PARAGRAPH
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The orb is the polar curve r(theta, t) sampled at n uniform angles and drawn as a
 * CLOSED cubic Bezier chain built by uniform Catmull-Rom -> Bezier conversion, which
 * is provably C1 (see section 1). r is a unit radius perturbed by fractal Brownian
 * motion: several octaves of 2D simplex noise sampled along a CIRCLE in noise space,
 * so the perturbation is 2*pi-periodic in theta by construction and the loop closes
 * with no seam (section 2). Four slow, large-feature octaves ("fluid") carry the AI
 * voice as deep rolling waves; three fast, small-feature octaves ("user") carry the
 * student's voice as high-frequency perimeter shimmer. Everything that can change --
 * amplitudes, and all 20 per-state style parameters -- passes through frame-rate
 * independent damping (cascaded one-pole for audio, critically-damped spring for
 * state), and every rate-driven quantity is integrated as a PHASE rather than
 * multiplied by absolute time, so a rate change alters speed and never position
 * (section 4). That is the whole reason nothing in here can visibly snap.

 * 2. THE OCTAVE TABLES
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Each octave samples the noise field along a circle of radius rN centred at a
 * drifting offset:
 *
 *   sample_j(theta) = simplex( offX_j + rN_j*cos(theta + swirl_j),
 *                              offY_j + rN_j*sin(theta + swirl_j) )
 *
 * Because the sample path is a closed circle, sample_j is exactly 2*pi-periodic in
 * theta -- no wrap blending, no windowing, no seam. Simplex features are ~1 unit
 * across, so a circle of radius rN traverses about 2*pi*rN features: rN SETS THE LOBE
 * COUNT. Never use an integer angular multiplier (m*theta) to get more lobes -- that
 * re-traverses the same path m times and stamps visible m-fold symmetry on the orb.
 *
 * Octaves 0..3 = FLUID (body, AI-driven). Octaves 4..6 = USER (perimeter shimmer).
 * Persistence 0.5, lacunarity ~2.1 within each group: textbook fBm, which is what
 * makes it read as organic rather than merely wobbly.
 *
 * The 30x drift-rate gap between the groups (0.055-0.24 u/s vs 1.7-4.4 u/s), plus
 * 3.5-34 lobes vs 18-42 lobes, is the entire perceptual distinction between "slow deep
 * rolling AI waves" and "fast energetic user vibration".
 *
 * Top user octave is 42.1 lobes, so it needs 4.5*42.1 = 190 samples to clear the
 * band-limiter below at full weight. That is why the sample count is FLOORED at
 * MIN_SAMPLES (see section 5) rather than being derived from the orb's pixel size
 * alone: sizing n from pixels put a 1707x876 laptop at n = 114, where this octave's
 * band gain is exactly 0 and the entire "fast energetic user vibration" band is
 * silently deleted. Above 190 the extra samples cost nothing that matters (7 octaves
 * x 190 samples ~ 70 us/frame) and below it the shimmer aliases into crawling moire.

 * on a 1280x800 window the sizing rule yields n = 104, where the 42-lobe user octave
 * gets 2.5 samples per lobe — below the 3 samples a smooth curve needs, so it aliases
 * into exactly the crawling moire the brief warns about. Verified by counting extrema
 * around the ring: the top octave really does paint 45 lobes.
 *
 * The fix is textbook: band-limit the fBm to the sampling rate. Each octave is faded
 * out as its lobe count approaches the sample count, so a small orb quietly loses its
 * finest shimmer instead of sparkling with alias. Full weight below n/4.5 samples per
 * lobe, zero above n/3.2, smoothstep between — and because the sum is renormalised

 *  Speaking    radiusFactor 1.18 * aiSwell 0.22 swells to ~1.46x nominal at full AI
 *              amplitude. glow 1.35 blows the rim out. lowOctaveBias 1.7 plus a 10 s
 *              breath is where "slow deep fluid rolling waves" comes from.
 *  Idle        radiusFactor 0.16 with an absolute 9 px floor; noiseGain 0 makes it a

 *                         (the trailing 0.9 is the energy gate). Lands exactly on the
 *                         design budget of ~7.7% / 15.4% peak.
 *   Listening user ripple at aUser 0.8: 0.075*0.8 = 0.060  ->  2.6% rms / 6.7% peak.
 *
 * FLAG — the brief's own sanity check predicts +-5% / +-10.5% for that second case,
 * which requires the USER term to peak around 1.75; a normalised sum of decorrelated
 * noise peaks near 1. The parameter table is the operative spec and is implemented
 * verbatim, so `userRipple` is left at 0.075. If the rim should visibly ripple harder
 * during Listening, 0.12 is the value that lands on the brief's stated 10.5% peak —

   * to K = d1/(1 - ratio) with no division by a time constant at all.
   *
   * Verify it at dt = 0: y2 = u + K + d2 - K = y2(0). Correct. As dt -> infinity both
   * exponentials vanish and y2 -> u. Correct. The step response from rest is a

   * 7. THE CLOSED C1 CURVE — uniform Catmull-Rom converted to cubic Bezier
   * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   * For the segment from P[i1] to P[i2], with neighbours P[i0] and P[i3]:
   *
   *   C1 = P[i1] + s*(P[i2] - P[i0])/3
   *   C2 = P[i2] - s*(P[i3] - P[i1])/3
   *
   * WHY THIS IS C1 (the proof, not the claim):
   *   The incoming segment's end tangent is
   *       3*(P_end - C2) = 3*(P[i2] - (P[i2] - s*(P[i3]-P[i1])/3)) = s*(P[i3]-P[i1]).
   *   The next segment (whose i1' = i2, i0' = i1, i2' = i3) has start tangent
   *       3*(C1' - P[i2]) = 3*(s*(P[i3]-P[i1])/3)                 = s*(P[i3]-P[i1]).
   *   Identical VECTORS, not merely identical directions — so the join is C1, not just
   *   G1, under uniform parameterisation. Curvature (C2) is discontinuous at joints,
   *   but a CORNER requires a tangent discontinuity and there is none. That is why the
   *   outline cannot show a point however violently the noise moves it.
   *
   * THE CLASSIC BUG: emitting n-1 segments and letting closePath() join the ends. That
   * inserts a straight chord and produces exactly one visible corner, always at the
   * same angle, which reads as a defect. All n segments are emitted, with wrapped
   * indices; closePath() is then a no-op that only guarantees the stroke closes.
   *
   * WHY lineTo FAILS: at n = 192 on a 300 px orb the chord is ~9.8 px, so a perfect
   * circle already shows a 1.875-degree exterior angle at every vertex under a 2 px hot
   * stroke with additive glow. Worse, the 42-lobe user octave displaces ADJACENT
   * samples in opposite directions, spiking the local exterior angle to 20-35 degrees.
   * Polyline geometry produces the forbidden sharp points by construction.
