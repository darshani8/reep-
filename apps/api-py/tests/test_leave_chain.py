"""B10.1/B10.2/B10.4/B10.7/B10.8 — who may sign a leave request, what the
submit path refuses, how an applicant withdraws, and what a non-approver sees.

The five things this module holds down, and what comes back if it is deleted:

1. ONE SIGNATURE, THE OFFICE'S (2026-09-16). The two-signature chain — a
   MENTOR or a scoped grantee first, a different approver second — deadlocked
   every staff request on a one-admin deployment at FIRST_APPROVED, and the
   owner's answer was a single decision by the Main Admin. So: the office's
   APPROVE is a sanction, a mentoring colleague is refused the queue and the
   signature outright, and a row signed once under the old chain is completed
   by the office's one decision. Delete these and "a faculty member with a
   mentee may sign leave" comes back through whichever gate is loosened first.
2. THE RETIRED KEY ADMITS NOBODY. `mentor.leave_approve` left the catalogue
   with the door; a grant row still naming it (migration `d8b1f4c2a7e9`
   revokes them, but a row can be written by hand) must open nothing.
3. THE SUBMIT CHECKS ARE SILENT UNTIL THE OFFICE RECORDS AN ALLOWANCE. Delete
   `test_the_submit_checks_sleep_until_a_balance_exists` and a table nobody has
   filled in starts refusing requests the form accepted yesterday — on the
   college's own paper form, which the owner asked not to change.
4. CANCELLED IS REACHABLE ONLY BY ASKING. Neither queue returned a withdrawn
   request before B10.4; widening `/history`'s default instead would have put
   them into the Approved and Rejected tabs of a console already built against
   it.
5. THE REDUCED PROJECTION IS A SHAPE, NOT A CONVENTION. `LeaveOut.reason` is
   free text and routinely medical. `LeaveBrief` cannot carry one because it has
   no field for one, and `test_the_reduced_projection_cannot_carry_a_reason`
   is what stops the next reader adding it "just for the alternate's screen".
