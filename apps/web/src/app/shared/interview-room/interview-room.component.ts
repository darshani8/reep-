/**
 * The interview room — REEP's realtime AI mock interviewer, as ONE component
 * rendered in two places.
 *
 * Press Start, the microphone opens, a WebSocket to /api/interview carries
 * 24 kHz PCM both ways, and an interviewer calibrated to a Tier-1
 * multinational's campus round asks one question at a time and critiques the
 * answer. Everything audio lives in InterviewService; this component owns the
 * stage (the orb, the status, the captions, the phase stepper, the clock, the
 * mic meter), the track picker, the consent dialog, the transcript and the
 * practice report.
 *
 * It was the body of features/assistant/assistant.component.ts. That page
 * still exists at /student/assistant (the deep link the Interviews screen and
 * the landing's Elevate card use) and renders this component in `page` mode
 * under its heading and the saved-conversation panel. The floating dock in the
 * shell (layout/agent-dock.component.ts) renders it in `dock` mode beside the
 * typed REEP Agent, so an interview can be started from any screen. One
 * component, because a consent dialog, a close-code table and a scorecard
 * parse maintained twice would disagree on the first fix to either.
 *
 * THE DOCK SERVICE MIRROR. The orb in the shell pulses while an interview is
 * live and shows its clock, and it must not import InterviewService to learn
 * that (the service and the visualizer are ~5 000 lines that the initial
 * bundle does not carry — the dock `@defer`s this component). So an effect
 * below writes a three-word state and the clock into AgentDockService, and
 * ngOnDestroy clears them, which is also the moment the microphone is
 * released. The room is the ONLY writer.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT HERE. The saved conversation (GET /api/agent/history) and its
 * Clear control belong to the page: they are the text agent's thread, which
 * the interviewer's turns are persisted into server-side, and the dock shows
 * that thread on its other tab.
 *
 * CONSENT IS A ROW ON THE SERVER, NOT A FLAG IN THIS BROWSER. It used to be a
 * localStorage key nothing on the server ever read: on a shared lab PC that
 * grant belonged to the machine rather than the person. Now `GET
 * /api/interview/consent` says which version the server is asking for and
 * whether this student holds a live grant for it; `POST` records one; and the
 * interview socket itself refuses (4013) without one. Accepting FAILS CLOSED:
 * if the grant cannot be recorded, the thing it authorises does not run.
 *
 * Status as TEXT AND COLOUR, never colour alone (AGENTS.md). The orb is
 * decoration; the pill beside it carries the words.
