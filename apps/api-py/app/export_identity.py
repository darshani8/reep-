"""The identity ledger: ``python -m app.export_identity``.

WHAT THIS IS, AND WHY IT IS NOT A BACKUP. A backup of the database answers
"restore last Tuesday". This answers a different question — "let these people
back in, into whatever we build next" — and the two need different artefacts
with different lifecycles, because they fail on different days.

The database backups are excellent and they are all bounded by the same number.
`backupRetentionDays` is validated 1..35 in `infra/cdk/reep_core/stack.py`
because RDS refuses more on its automated backups, and until the archive tier
that ceiling reached the AWS Backup rule and the cross-region copy as well. Even
with the archive tier, every one of those artefacts is a PHYSICAL snapshot: a
block-level image of PostgreSQL 17 on RDS, restorable only by standing up
PostgreSQL 17 on RDS. That is the right tool for "we dropped a table". It is the
wrong tool — eventually an unusable one, when that engine version is retired —
for "we rewrote the application and we still owe three thousand students the
account they already have".

So this module writes the smallest thing that can rebuild a login, in the most
boring format that will still open in ten years: one JSON object per person, one
line each, one file per day. No schema, no engine, no vendor. A person with a
text editor can read it, and a script in any language can replay it.

WHY THESE FIELDS AND NOT THE ROW. Three of them are the whole point and the rest
are what makes them usable:

  * ``person_uuid`` is ``users.id``, which is ``uuid4().hex`` — a string, not an
    autoincrement integer. That is the single property that makes this file
    replayable: the id is globally unique, was never derived from insert order,
    and can be re-inserted into any future schema as the primary key without
    colliding with anything. Every other record in the product hangs off it, so
    a restored academic history re-attaches to a restored login for free.
  * ``password_hash`` is carried VERBATIM. It is ``scrypt:<salt_hex>:<digest_hex>``
    — self-describing, no KMS key, no pepper, no external dependency. The format
    has already survived one whole-stack rewrite (Next.js to FastAPI) without a
    single password reset, which is the empirical case for carrying the string
    rather than inventing a migration. Accounts holding the SSO-only sentinel
    carry it too, because "this account has no password" is itself a fact that
    must survive.
  * ``google_sub`` is the Google principal the row is pinned to. ``email`` is how
    a sign-in FINDS a row; ``sub`` is what proves it is the same person as last
    time. An institutional address is a lease the college re-issues to the next
    intake — see the column's own comment in models/user.py — so a ledger that
    carried only the address would, on replay, hand a graduate's account to
    whoever holds that mailbox now.

INSTITUTION IS EXPORTED AS RESOLVED LABELS, NEVER AS FOREIGN KEYS, and this is
the detail that decides whether the file is worth anything. A future schema will
mint new cohort ids; ``"cohort_id": "a3f91c…"`` would preserve a pointer into a
database that no longer exists, which is a string that looks like data and is
not. ``"college": "BGSCET"`` re-resolves against any catalogue, including by
hand on the worst day.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT. Marks, attendance, uploads, interview transcripts,
mentor notes — everything that makes a student's record valuable and sensitive.
That is not an oversight and it is not a smaller version of the same thing: this
file is meant to live forever, off to one side, readable in a crisis, and every
field it carries is a field somebody has to keep safe forever. Identity is the
minimum that cannot be reconstructed from anything else. The academic history
comes back from a logical dump, keyed by the same ``person_uuid``, and that
ordering is the point — access is restored in minutes from a file measured in
megabytes, and the heavy data follows behind it.

WHERE IT GOES. ``IDENTITY_LEDGER_BUCKET`` blank means "no ledger destination
configured", and then this prints to stdout and says so rather than pretending:
the same honesty rule the voice platform's optional projections keep. Configured,
it writes one object per UTC day at ``<prefix>/YYYY/MM/DD.jsonl``. The bucket is
expected to carry versioning and S3 Object Lock, which is what keeps this file
outside the 35-day rule AND outside the reach of a compromised operator — but
this module does not and cannot enforce that, because a writer that could
weaken its own retention is not a retention control. `infra/cdk` owns the
bucket; see the `IdentityLedgerBucket` construct.

IT NEVER DELETES ANYTHING. There is no prune, no rotate, no `--force`. A day's
object is written once; re-running the same day overwrites that day's file with
a fresh read of the same table, which is idempotent in the only sense that
matters (the newest export of a person is the truest one). The history is the
object versions, which is why versioning is not optional on that bucket.

Exit code 0 means every account was read and the destination accepted the file.
Non-zero means it did not, and a non-zero here is worth waking somebody for:
this is the file that exists so that nothing else has to.

    seated student, `students.department_id` for one whose batch does not exist
    yet. `governance.ancestry_of_student` reads both for exactly this reason,
    and a ledger that read only the first would silently lose the college of
    every student at an institution that has not built its batches — which is
    the normal state of a new college, not an edge case.

    Staff get the same treatment through `users.department_id`, their own
    counterpart of `students.cohort_id`. A MENTOR row has no `students` row at
    all, so without that third path every faculty member would export with no
    college and the file could not say which institution they belonged to.
