"""The REEP Skills & Badge framework (developer framework doc, 2026-08).

THE BADGE CATALOGUE IS CODE; ONLY STUDENT STATE IS ROWS — the same rule as
`models/milestone.py`, for the same reason: the 48 badges below are the
programme's structure, identical for every student, and a rename must be a code
review, not a migration racing 5 000 rows. The framework document's §18 asks
for admin add/edit of badges; here that IS a code change, deliberately — what
administrators maintain in the database is everything that genuinely varies per
term: the Approved Certification Catalogue (§12), evidence verdicts, manual
awards/revocations, and assessment scores.

Four concepts, kept separate because the document keeps them separate (§10):

  skill/badge   BADGES below — code, name, category, stage, points
  evidence      badge_evidence — a claim with a type (§11) and a review status
                (§12); a student may hold SEVERAL evidence rows per badge, of
                different types ("Negotiation: External ✓, BGSCET ✓, Applied ✓")
  badge earned  student_badges — one row per (student, badge) once they move
                off "not started": IN_PROGRESS (self-marked) or EARNED
                (awarded on approved evidence, an assessment, or manually)
  growth        capability_assessments — the seven §9 capabilities on a 1–10
                scale at checkpoints T0–T4, staff-entered

Display status (§13) is DERIVED, never stored: no rows = Not Started; an
IN_PROGRESS row = In Progress; any pending evidence = Verification Pending; an
EARNED row = Earned, and Earned with fewer than the three evidence types
approved = "advanced evidence available". Deriving it means the word on the
screen cannot contradict the rows it summarises.

Certificate ≠ badge (§10): approving evidence is what mints the EARNED row, and
uploads on their own never do.
