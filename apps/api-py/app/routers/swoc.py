"""SWOC — Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Challenges: the editor.

    GET    /admin/swoc                        every student with their entries
    POST   /admin/swoc/{student_id}           add an entry (kind, text, weight)
    PATCH  /admin/swoc/entries/{entry_id}     edit text / weight
    DELETE /admin/swoc/entries/{entry_id}     remove

The MODEL IS NOT NEW. `swoc_entries` (app/models/swoc.py) has carried the
board since the Prisma port — one row per observation, attributed to a
VIEWPOINT (placement cell, mentor, programme manager) and weighted 1-5 — and
the student already reads it: `GET /student/swoc`, and inside
`GET /student/overview` as `swoc`, drawn on the Mentor / TPO Log and now on
the landing. What was missing was a WRITER. This is it.

GATED BY A CAPABILITY, NOT A ROLE — `admin.swoc`. The placement office holds
it by baseline; a faculty member holds it only when an administrator grants it
in Governance. "From TPO and mentor inputs" means more than one hand writes
the board, and Governance is where the owner decides whose.

AND THE GRANT NOW CARRIES A SCOPE (B1.2/B1.4), WHICH REVERSES WHAT THIS
DOCSTRING USED TO SAY. It read "PROGRAMME scope like the other admin screens:
the grant is the decision to let that person write for every student", and that
sentence was true of the mechanism and wrong about the act. A SWOC line names a
student and characterises them — it is the one thing on their landing page that
another person wrote about them — and "let this lecturer write for every student
in the institution" was never a decision anybody meant to make; it was the only
decision the grant could express. A grant may now name a college, a department,
a batch or one student, `scope_filter` narrows the board to it, and the writes
are narrowed by the same reach through `require_capability(..., target=...)`.
A programme-wide grant still exists and still means what it says; it is now a
choice rather than the only shape.

THE VIEWPOINT IS DERIVED, NOT TYPED. A MENTOR's entry is a MENTOR entry; a
the Main Admin's is the PLACEMENT cell's. The board is deliberately
un-averaged — disagreement between viewpoints is itself the finding — and a
select box that lets a mentor file an opinion as the office's would erase the
one thing the source column exists to keep.

Every write goes through record_change with the before/after snapshot: a line
that tells a student what their weakness is must be traceable to who wrote it
and what it replaced.

    `admin.swoc` for a whole department filed every line as MENTOR, including
    lines about students they have never met. Two viewpoints became one label.

    Now the relationship decides: a MENTOR-role account whose own `Mentor` group

    are granted faculty, so pointing the History button at the audit API would
    be a control that answers 403 for everybody who can press it.

    Both fences, the same two as every other write here: `admin.swoc` bare, then
    again with the student's ancestry as `target`. Reading what a colleague
    wrote and then unwrote about a student is reading about that student.

    AN EMPTY LIST MEANS "NO EDIT RECORDED", NOT "NEVER EDITED". This table began
    empty at Phase 4 and a line edited last year has nothing in it; the client
    says so in those words. The Main Admin still has the older history where it
