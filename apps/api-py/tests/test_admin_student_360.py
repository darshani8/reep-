"""B4.5 — `GET /api/admin/students/{id}/360`, the whole of one student.

WHAT THIS MODULE HOLDS DOWN, in the order a break would be quietest:

1. BOTH FENCES, SEPARATELY. The capability alone does not open rule 2, and rule
   2 alone does not open a scoped grant. Two tests, one per direction, because
   a change that reaches one system and not the other OPENS the other — which
   is not hypothetical in REEP, it is what the DIRECTOR removal did for a few
   hours.
2. NO NUMBER IS INVENTED. A semester whose dates were never recorded reports
   `null` activity, not `0`; a semester with no results row reports `null`
   results, not a row of zeros; an interview that produced no score does not
   drag the best score to 0. This is the rule that has already bitten three
   REEP screens.
3. THE READINESS IS THE STUDENT'S OWN. Byte-for-byte the payload the student
   reads on their own dashboard, because it is the same builder — a staff-shaped
   copy is how a mentor ends up seeing a confident 0 where the student sees a
   dash.
4. IT WRITES NOTHING. No audit row of its own, however many times it is opened.
