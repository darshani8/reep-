"""The generated resume, and what it is allowed to say.

INCIDENT (2026-09-09, end-to-end test of the Resume Builder): a student filled
all fifteen sections of the builder, the sidebar read 100% complete, and the
document that came out carried none of it — no experience, no internships, no
projects, no publications, no certifications, no positions, no objective, no
referees. `_compose_resume_markdown` read the `student_profiles` row, the
verified skills and the academic record; the builder wrote `resume_profiles.data`
and nothing read it. The preview said "this resume is drawing on your full
record" over a five-line page.

Two tests hold that shut from opposite sides, and both are needed:

  * `test_the_document_carries_every_builder_section` fails if a section stops
    reaching the page. Written as one marker per section so the assertion names
    the section that regressed rather than reporting "markdown differs".
  * `test_the_document_never_carries_the_private_sections` fails if one starts.
    The builder is ALSO the placement office's intake form, so the same map
    holds next-of-kin details, a date of birth, medical history and demographics
    that the screens promise will not travel. A composer that publishes by
    default is one forgotten `if` away from putting a student's medical history
    in front of an employer.

The completeness tests are here for the same reason the composer is: the bar
that says "70%+ produces a materially stronger document" was reachable by
pressing "Add another number" and typing nothing.
