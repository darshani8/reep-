"""Prove that every capability in the catalogue is checked somewhere in app/.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `app/models/governance.py` says it in words already:

    "Adding a capability is a code change on purpose: each one has to be
     enforced at a call site, and a row that names a capability nothing checks
     is a promise the API does not keep."

A key nobody checks is worse than a missing feature, because it is VISIBLE. It
appears in Governance, the Main Admin grants it to a faculty member with a
reason, the audit row records the grant -- and nothing anywhere changes. The
office believes it handed something over; the holder believes they were given
something; the API never asked. That is a lie with a paper trail, and the only
moment anyone can catch it is the moment the key is added.

So this is the counterpart of `tools/ci/check_pii_gate.py`: a static AST walk
that asks the source, not the runtime, whether a human wired the key up.

WHAT IT LOOKS FOR. Every call to `require_capability`, `has_capability` or
`policies.scope_filter`, ANYWHERE under `app/` -- not only inside a route
handler. `admin.interview_audio` is checked inside `interview_records.py`'s
`_require_developer` helper and reaches four endpoints through it; a scan that
only inspected `@router`-decorated functions would report it unenforced and send
the next person to "fix" a thing that works.

MODULE-LEVEL CONSTANTS ARE RESOLVED. Three routers -- admin_students.py,
swoc.py, interview_bank.py -- declare `CAPABILITY = "admin.x"` once and pass the
NAME at sixteen call sites. A grep for string literals finds none of them and
demands they be enforced, which is exactly the false alarm that teaches people
to switch a guard off.

THE ONE EXEMPTION, AND WHY IT IS NOT A LOOPHOLE.

    ui.console_v2

is unenforceable BY DESIGN and must stay in the catalogue until Phase 5 deletes
it. It does not gate an endpoint: it selects which admin console a session
renders, and it is read by `apps/web/src/app/app.routes.ts` and
`app-shell.component.ts` off `/auth/me`'s capability list. There is no server
request to refuse -- refusing one would break the old console, which is the
thing it exists to keep reachable. Any OTHER key that wants to sit here is
almost certainly a key that should be deleted instead, so the exemption is a
dict with a written reason rather than a set of strings.

Run it:

    python3 apps/api-py/tools/ci/check_capability_enforcement.py
