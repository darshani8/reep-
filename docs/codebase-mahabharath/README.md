# The REEP Codebase Bible

An exhaustive, teaching-first account of the REEP stack: what every module does, why
every line reads the way it does, which rule each piece of code exists to protect, and
the naming conventions that keep 34,000 lines legible.

**Fifteen chapters, 270,277 words, complete.** Chapters 15 and 16 were merged into one closing
volume covering both the rulebook and the runbooks.

This is written to be *read in order* by someone who has never opened the repo, and
*grepped out of order* by someone who has. Every chapter cites real files and real
symbols — `path/to/file.py:120` — so nothing here is a paraphrase you cannot check.

## How this book was built

Each chapter is produced by a **council**: a fan-out of independent reader agents that
map the code, a drafter that writes from those maps, a panel of judges that scores the
draft against a fixed rubric, and a reviser that rewrites against the panel's critique.
Every agent reasons privately (chain-of-thought) before answering, then self-scores and
revises — a reward loop applied to prose. A final verifier re-opens every file cited and
confirms each symbol, line number and claim actually exists. Chapters that fail
verification are rewritten, not shipped with a caveat.

| 6 | [The Student API](06-api-student.md) | All 49 student-reachable endpoints: `student.py`, `registration.py`, `leave.py`, and the rule engines behind readiness, next-actions and leaderboards |
| 7 | [HTTP API — Staff & Machine Surface](07-api-staff.md) | `mentor`, `director`, `agent`, `voice`, `health` routers |
| 8 | [The AI Layer](08-ai-layer.md) | `ai/llm.py`, the egress gate (Rule 1), `agents.py`, `orchestrator.py`, `adk.py`, `assistant/tools.py` |

| 10 | [Vector DB & the Knowledge Base](10-vector-kb.md) | pgvector, `ai/embeddings.py`, hybrid retrieval in `knowledge.py`, `seed_kb.py` |
| 11 | [The Voice Assistant](11-voice.md) | `api/legacy/voice_assistant.py`, `voice_agent.py`, the state machine, consent, transcripts, heartbeats |
| 12 | [Frontend Architecture](12-frontend-architecture.md) | Bootstrap, lazy routes, `core/` services, guards, the shell, signals |
| 13 | [Frontend Features](13-frontend-features.md) | Every feature component, the resume builder, the assistant UI |
| 14 | [The Design System](14-design-system.md) | `reep-v2.scss`, the kit, `tone.ts`, charts, the colour-plus-text rule |
| 15 | [Conventions, Rules and Running It](15-conventions-rules-ops.md) | The complete naming compendium and rulebook, plus docker, env vars, the two requirements files, the two seeds, the suite, CI and every runbook |

Open questions and confirmed defects the council turned up while writing are tracked in
[FINDINGS.md](FINDINGS.md). Readers flag what they cannot verify rather than inventing it,
and some of those flags were real.
