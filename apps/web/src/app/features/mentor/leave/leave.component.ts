/**
 * Faculty Leave — the official BGSCET form, and the requests made on it.
 *
 * A dashboard of the faculty member's own requests, and behind each one the
 * one-page document itself: the institution heading, the strike-off line naming
 * which of Casual Leave / Permission / OOD / RH / LOP is being applied for, the
 * main table (Name, Designation, Department, Date, Purpose, Credit,
 * Sanctioned), the two signature blocks, and the Alternate Arrangements section
 * with its five-column table and its own staff signature.
 *
 * THE FORM IS THE SOURCE OF TRUTH FOR WHAT IT ASKS. Fields the printed sheet
 * does not have are not added to it — no employee id, no phone number, no leave
 * balance cell. A leave form that collects more than the college's own form is
 * a different document with the college's letterhead on it. (The allowance is
 * READ on the dashboard, beside the list of requests. That is not a field on
 * the sheet and nothing is collected by it; it is there because REEP can now
 * REFUSE a form for want of days, and a refusal whose number the applicant
 * cannot see anywhere is a refusal they cannot act on.)
 *
 * THREE THINGS ARRIVED BESIDE THE FORM IN PHASE 4, AND NONE OF THEM IS ON IT.
 * The sheet's fields, its Sign button, `signAndSubmit`'s payload and the
 * submit endpoint are byte for byte what they were — the owner's instruction,
 * restated in five places in this repository. What is new sits AROUND the
 * document, where a covering note and a filing clerk would be:
 *
 *   - ATTACHED PAPERS (B10.3). A supporting document is not a field on the
 *     form; it is the medical certificate that travels WITH it. It is offered
 *     only on a request that already exists, so nothing about signing changed,
 *     and `document_store` decides the types and the sizes — this screen
 *     restates neither and prints the server's own refusal.
 *   - WITHDRAW (B10.4). `POST /leaves/{id}/cancel`, the applicant's own, and
 *     only while the request is still awaiting a signature. Two-tapped, like
 *     the signature screen's Remove, because a request cannot be un-withdrawn.
 *   - ASKED TO COVER (B10.6). The other side of the Alternate Arrangements
 *     table: which colleagues have named THIS account, from
 *     `/leaves/alternate/mine`. It answers the reduced projection — the dates,
 *     the printed option, the state and the one row addressed to you — and
 *     carries no `reason`, because a colleague asked to take a Tuesday class
 *     is not thereby entitled to somebody's diagnosis.
 *
 * THE OTHER HALF OF B10.6 HAS NO CONTROL HERE, AND THAT IS NOT AN OVERSIGHT.
 * A row is linked to an account by `POST /leaves/{id}/alternate/assign`, which
 * is the applicant's own act — and to offer it this screen would have to list
 * the applicant's colleagues. Every faculty listing in the API is
 * `require_admin` (`admin_faculty.list_faculty`, `admin_mentoring.mentor_load`),
 * so a MENTOR applicant can reach none of them, and a staff directory a faculty
 * account may read is a scope decision nobody has made — who, exactly: their
 * department, their college, the deployment? Rather than invent one, or make
 * the applicant type a user id, the control is absent and this is the note
 * saying so. Until it exists the list below is empty for everybody, which is
 * why it is drawn only when it has rows: an empty "Colleagues who named you"
 * heading would be this screen reporting a feature it cannot offer.
 *
 * APPROVALS ARE NOT HERE. This screen is a faculty member applying for
 * themselves; the queue that decides these lives in the admin area, because the
 * PROGRAM DIRECTOR block on the form is signed by the programme director and
 * not by a peer. The server enforces that independently — staff leave has no
 * student group, so `/leaves/pending` narrows it to DIRECTOR/ADMIN.
 *
 * Name, Designation and Department are printed from the user record and are not
 * editable: they are what the institution holds, and a form whose identity
 * fields can be typed over is not evidence of anything.
 *
 * DRAFTS LIVE IN THIS BROWSER, AND SAY SO. `leave_requests` has no DRAFT status
 * — a row exists once it is signed — so "Save draft" keeps the unsigned form in
 * localStorage, one per device, labelled "saved on this device" wherever it is
 * shown. Nothing about it reaches the server until Sign & submit. "Edit &
 * resubmit" on a rejected request copies that form into a new draft; the
 * rejected row itself stays exactly as the director decided it.
