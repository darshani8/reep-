"""Prove that `app/` imports nothing requirements.txt does not declare.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `app/interview/offline_engine.py` reached main importing numpy with no
entry in any requirements file. It survived review and it survived CI, because
of exactly one detail: the import is LAZY — it sits inside a request handler —
so the API still booted, every existing test still passed, and the break was
invisible until either a student hit the local-engine path in production or
someone ran the suite on a machine where numpy had not been pip-installed by
hand for something else.

The voice worker has had a guard for this shape of bug since the day
requirements-voice.txt shipped a manifest that omitted four of the packages
voice_agent.py imported (`worker-imports` in .github/workflows/ci.yml). The API
had no equivalent. This is it.

HOW IT WORKS, and why it is import-based rather than a static scan. Walking the
AST for `import` statements sounds tidier, but it cannot tell a third-party
package from a first-party module or a stdlib one without reimplementing the
resolver, and it misses `importlib.import_module(name)`. Actually importing
every module under `app.` in an environment built from requirements.txt ALONE
asks the real question — "can a production image import this?" — and answers it
the same way the runtime will.

Run in CI against a clean install of requirements.txt (NOT -dev: pytest and
friends are not in the image, so a module that imports one of them is just as
broken as one importing numpy). Locally:
