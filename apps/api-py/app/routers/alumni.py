"""Alumni area — the profile an alumnus creates on first sign-in, and the jobs
sheet.

ALUMNI only, and their OWN row only: an alumnus is neither staff (rule 2's gate
never admits them) nor a student. That second half USED to rest on "no Student
row", and B4.4 ended it — a graduated batch keeps its `students` rows, because
they are the record of the marks, badges and interviews those people earned
here, so a graduate's session carries a perfectly valid `studentId` claim. What
refuses them the student endpoints now is the ROLE check inside
`routers/student.py::_require_student` and its twin in `student_programme.py`.
The two surfaces here are deliberately small:

  * GET/POST /alumni/profile — `created: false` from the GET is what sends the
    client to the first-login create form; the POST upserts (company required,
    resume through the same hardened document_store as student uploads).
  * GET /alumni/jobs — the postings sheet, WITHOUT the student feed's match %
    and eligibility verdict: those are computed from a Student's skills and
    marks, which an alumnus does not have. Public posting fields only, so
    rule 1 is untouched — nothing here goes near a model.
