"""The Time Allocation Ledger — six slots covering a 24-hour day, five activity
heads, hours to the nearest half.

This is NOT a replacement for `time_sheet_entries` and does not read it. That
table answers "how many minutes of SKILLING has this student logged this week",
which the dashboard chart and the weekly target still ask; this one answers
"what did the 24 hours of Thursday actually look like, slot by slot". Merging
them would have meant either losing the slot dimension or inventing a fake slot
for every historical row, so they are separate tables with separate questions.

THE UNIT IS THE HALF HOUR, STORED AS AN INTEGER. The design specifies hours to
the nearest half, and the day must reconcile to exactly 24 h before it may be
submitted. A float column makes that check a game of epsilons — 0.1 + 0.2 style
drift across thirty cells is enough to leave a perfectly filled day sitting at
23.999999 and refusing to submit, with nothing on screen to explain it. Integers
of half-hours make "does this add to 24" an exact comparison against 48, and the
API converts at the edge so the client still speaks in hours.

Every cell is bounded twice, and both bounds live in `SLOT_CAPACITY_HALVES`
below: no single cell may exceed its slot's capacity, and no slot's five cells
may sum past it either. A 4-hour slot holding 5 hours of lectures is not a
rounding problem, it is a data-entry error that would silently make the day
totals meaningless.
