"""Leave requests — submit, and ONE decision by the Main Admin.

ONE SIGNATURE, THE OFFICE'S (2026-09-16). Any signed-in account submits.
The MAIN ADMIN alone decides: APPROVE moves SUBMITTED -> APPROVED, REJECT
moves it to REJECTED, and that is the whole chain. Nobody else sees the
approver's queue, nobody else may sign, and the Main Admin cannot decide its
own request. The owner's instruction, in their words: leave approval is the
Main Admin's power only, and a single approval — no second step.

WHAT IT REPLACES, kept here because the shape of the old rule explains the
columns that are still on the row. Until this date a request needed TWO
DISTINCT signatures (SUBMITTED -> FIRST_APPROVED -> APPROVED), the first from a
MENTOR over their own group or from a faculty member holding a SCOPED GRANT of
`mentor.leave_approve` (B10.1's "third door"), the second from a different
approver. On a deployment with one office account and no such grant that
chain deadlocked every staff request at FIRST_APPROVED with a live "Sanction"
button, and the owner's answer was not a second signer but a single one. So:

  * `first_*` are what a decision writes now; `second_*` stay NULL on every
    new row. The paper and the console read `second or first`, so a request
    decided under either rule prints its decider. `LeaveStatus.FIRST_APPROVED`
    and the `second_*` columns stay for the rows that carry them — a Postgres
    enum value cannot be dropped — and `decide_leave` completes such a row
    with the office's one decision, whoever signed it first.
  * `mentor.leave_approve` is GONE from the capability catalogue and from the
    derived mentor functions; migration `d8b1f4c2a7e9` revokes every live
    grant of it. A key nothing checks is a promise the API does not keep
    (B2.1), and a faculty member offered "Approve leave" in Governance would
    be offered a screen that answers 403.
  * `_assert_can_decide` still exists and still returns the function the
    decider acted in, because `leave_paper.py`, `leave_attachments.py`,
    `leave_alternate.py` and `leave_policy.py` import it as THE gate on
    reading somebody else's request; it now admits the Main Admin and nobody
    else, with the same flattened 404 for everybody else.

RULE 2 ON THE APPLICANT'S SIDE IS UNCHANGED: `/mine`, `POST` and `/cancel` are
the applicant's own and gate on nothing but the session; `reason` is free
text and routinely medical, which is why the queues are the office's alone.

WHAT THE APPLICANT SEES AND WHAT A THIRD PARTY SEES ARE DIFFERENT PROJECTIONS
(B10.7). `_leave_out` carries `reason` and is for the applicant and the office;
`_leave_brief` carries dates, the printed option, the state and the one
alternate row addressed to the caller, and is for anybody else with a reason
to open the record.

    Role first, before any DB read: the refusal must not depend on whether

    which error comes back. Then `_assert_can_decide`, which hands back the
    FUNCTION it admitted on — stamped beside the signature below and printed
    on the paper (B10.1/B10.8).

    completed by this same decision, written into the `second_*` slot so the
    first signer's stamp is not rewritten. Whether the first signature was the

    the office its own second stroke was the deadlock the rule removed.
