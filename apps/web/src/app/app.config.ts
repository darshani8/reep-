     * THE SERVICE WORKER, AND THE ONE THING IT MUST NEVER CACHE.
     *
     * REEP is installed to a student's home screen (public/manifest.webmanifest),
     * and an installed app that cannot open without a signal is a worse promise
     * than a bookmark. The worker caches the APP — index.html, the chunks, the
     * stylesheet, the self-hosted fonts and the icons — so the shell paints on
     * a bad campus connection and so a chunk request cannot 404 halfway through
     * a deploy.
     *
     * `ngsw-config.json` HAS NO `dataGroups`, AND THAT ABSENCE IS THE POINT.
     * A dataGroup is how ngsw caches API responses, and every interesting
     * response on this deployment is rule 1 material: marks, attendance, a USN,
     * an interview transcript. Cached, they would be written to the device's
     * disk by the BROWSER rather than by this app, outliving the httpOnly
     * `reep_session` cookie, surviving sign-out, and surviving the
     * single-device retirement in app/security.py — which exists precisely so
     * that signing in elsewhere ends the old session. They would also be
     * unreachable from `purge_students` and `purge_people`, which can empty a
     * database and cannot touch a Cache Storage entry on a handset in
     * Bengaluru. The file is strict JSON and cannot hold this comment, so it
     * lives here, beside the line that turns the worker on.
     *
     * `navigationUrls` excludes `/api/**` for the neighbouring reason: without
     * it a navigation-shaped request to the API would be answered with
     * index.html out of the cache, and a student would get the app shell where
     * a document download or an error should have been.
     *
     * ENABLED ONLY WHERE A WORKER IS BUILT. `ng build` writes ngsw-worker.js
     * under the production configuration only, so registering it in dev would
     * be a permanent 404 in the console on every developer's machine.
     * `registerWhenStable:30000` keeps the registration off the critical path —
     * the worker is fetched once the app goes stable, or after 30s if it never
     * does (a long-poll or an open WebSocket can keep it unstable, and this app
     * holds one open for the whole of a mock interview).
