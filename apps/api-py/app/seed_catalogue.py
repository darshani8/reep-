"""The institutional catalogue: ``python -m app.seed_catalogue --college 1MP``.

WHAT THIS IS FOR. The spine -- College -> Department -> Course -> Specialization
-> Batch -> Student -- is the backbone every other decision in REEP hangs off:
rule 2's scope, a grant's reach, a feature override's blast radius, the policy a
student's interview runs under, and which interview TRACK their mock interview
preselects. Until this release the only ways to write it were the Main Admin's
Catalogue screen, one form at a time, and `app.seed`, which refuses on
`ENV=prod` because it also mints the demo logins.

That left a real deployment with exactly one route: about fifteen forms per
college, typed by hand, with one field in them -- a specialization's `code` --
that silently decides whether that college's students can ever be SCORED. Get it
wrong and nothing anywhere reports it; the student simply meets a picker that
says "General interview", and a generic interview has no wrap-up phase and so
produces no scorecard. That is the same dead end `grant_access --department-id`
was added to close, and closing it at the account while leaving it open at the
catalogue is closing one of two doors into the same room.

So the catalogue is CODE and only the student state is a row -- the milestone
and badge rule (`app/models/milestone.py`, `app/models/badge.py`) applied to the
institution. A college is a block in `CATALOGUES` below, reviewed in a pull
request, checked by a test, and written by pressing one button.

PRODUCTION-SAFE AND IDEMPOTENT, like `app.seed_kb` and unlike `app.seed`: it
creates no accounts, holds no passwords and has nothing to refuse on `ENV=prod`.
Re-running it writes nothing it has already written. It is ADDITIVE ONLY -- it
never renames, never deletes, never archives. A college that has diverged from
this file is reported, not corrected: a seeder that "fixed" a name the office
changed on screen last week would be a seeder that undoes people's work every
time somebody presses the button.

THE CODES ARE THE WHOLE POINT, so read this before adding a college.
`routers/interview_policy._default_track` preselects a student's interview track
by exact, case-folded match, most specific rung first: a track mapped to the
batch's specialization, the specialization's own `code`, a track mapped to the
course, the course's own `code`. So a specialization coded `fa` gets the
Financial Analytics interviewer and one coded `FIN` gets nothing at all. The
model's own column comment suggests `FIN`; that comment predates the interview
matrix and is the trap this module exists to keep people out of.

Codes that match nothing today are LEGITIMATE and are not an error: BGSCET's
Marketing specialization and its Logistics & Supply Chain course have no
built-in track, and the office can add one on the Interview Tracks screen
whenever it likes -- at which point the match starts working with no change
here, because both halves are the same string. What this module will not do is
let that be a surprise: every run prints, per leaf, whether a student there gets
a preselected track today and names the code that would make it so.

WHY IT SEEDS BATCHES TOO. A catalogue with no batch places nobody:
`ancestry_of_student` reaches the course and specialization rungs through
`cohorts`, so a student not seated in a batch has no course and no
specialization, whatever the catalogue says. One batch per LEAF of the tree is
therefore the smallest useful thing, not an extra.

    ADDITIVE ONLY. An existing row is returned UNTOUCHED even where its fields
    differ from this file -- see the module docstring: the office renames things
    on screen, and a seeder that reasserted its own names would quietly undo
    that work on every run. Divergence is reported by `seed()`, never corrected.

    THE SELECT-THEN-INSERT IS A RACE, AND IT IS CLOSED WITH A SAVEPOINT RATHER
    THAN A BARE `except`. Two runs that both find nothing both insert, and the
    loser hits the unique constraint. The Ops task carries `concurrency:
    ops-task`, so two button presses queue rather than overlap -- but this module
    is also runnable as a one-off ECS task with a command override, which nothing
    serialises, and "idempotent" is a promise this file makes in its own
    docstring.

    THE OBVIOUS FIX DOES NOT WORK ON POSTGRES, which is why this is worth the
    eight lines. Catching `IntegrityError` and re-querying inside the same
    transaction fails: Postgres ABORTS a transaction on error and refuses every
    later statement in it ("current transaction is aborted, commands ignored
    until end of transaction block"), so the recovering SELECT raises too. The
    result would LOOK like graceful recovery and would in fact turn one clear
    failure into a confusing one. `begin_nested()` issues a SAVEPOINT, so the
    rollback undoes only the failed INSERT and the outer transaction -- which
    holds every row written so far, and commits once at the end -- survives.

    A re-select that finds NOTHING is re-raised rather than swallowed. Only a
    row matching this call's own `where` proves we lost the race; any other
    IntegrityError (a different constraint, a `cohorts.code` collision with some
