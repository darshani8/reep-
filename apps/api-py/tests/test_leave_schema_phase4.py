"""Phase 4e, stage 1 — the leave schema, and the four things about it that are
invisible at every call site.

Everything here is a guard against a specific way the next person to touch this
area goes wrong, and each one has a reason written on it:

1. THE SIX VERDICTS. Three new tables, two destructors, and the pair that would
   hurt most is the one that looks most alike: `leave_balances` is per-person
   and goes, `academic_calendar` is a college catalogue and stays, and they live
   in ONE model module. `purge_people.check_verdicts()` only insists that every
   table is CLASSIFIED; nothing but this asserts they were classified
   CORRECTLY, and both mistakes are silent — a wrong KEEP leaves a departed
   student's medical certificate on the volume, a wrong EMPTY destroys a
   calendar the office typed in.

2. EVERY FK INDEXED. `tests/test_codebase_guards.py` already sweeps the whole
   schema for this. Pinned again here, per column, because that sweep reports a
   list and this says which ones were meant.

3. NO PG ENUM. `leave_balances.kind`, `academic_calendar.kind`,
   `first_signed_as` and `second_signed_as` are all vocabularies, which is
   exactly the shape somebody "fixes" into an enum. Three of AGENTS.md's
   gotchas fire if they do, and B10.1's function vocabulary is the part still
   being argued about — there is no HOD ACCOUNT in this product at all — so it
   must stay a data change.

4. `leave_status` ALREADY CARRIED `CANCELLED`. Since a80068bf03da created the
   type with all five values, in 2026. B10.4 therefore needs NO enum work, and
   the failure mode this pins is somebody helpfully adding an
   `ALTER TYPE leave_status ADD VALUE 'CANCELLED'` migration — which fails on
   every database that already has it and blocks the deploy.
