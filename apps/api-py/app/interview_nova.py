"""The Amazon Nova 2 Sonic engine behind the REEP mock interviewer.

    browser  <--WS /api/interview-->  THIS PROCESS  <--HTTP/2-->  Bedrock

THE hosted engine, and the default one (`INTERVIEW_ENGINE=nova`);
app/interview_local.py is the alternative that keeps everything on the machine.
The contracts both hold to — the persona, the records, the close codes, the
caps — live in app/interview_core.py.

The DOWNSTREAM event vocabulary (`response.created`, `response.done`,
`conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.completed`, the five `reep.*`
controls) is inherited from the OpenAI relay this replaced, and is kept
deliberately: it is the Angular client's contract, the client is good, and
renaming events to match whichever model is speaking would be churn paid for in
a screen students depend on. The event names are the contract; which model
produced the audio is an implementation detail the browser must never know.

NO API KEY, AND THAT IS THE POINT. The relay's OPENAI_API_KEY was a spendable
credential that had to be pasted into the environment of every host that runs an
interview. This engine has none: the bidirectional stream is signed with SigV4
from whatever the standard AWS chain resolves — the ECS task role, the instance
profile, an SSO profile, or the environment — so an AWS-hosted REEP grants
`bedrock:InvokeModelWithBidirectionalStream` to the role it already has and
stores no secret anywhere.

RULE 1 (AGENTS.md) reads here EXACTLY as it read in the relay, and for the
same reason: Bedrock is a remote provider. No student record enters this
session — no marks, attendance, CGPA, USN or resume text. What this module
authors upstream is the fixed `_INTERVIEWER_PERSONA`, the fixed per-phase and
per-turn directives composed in app/interview_matrix.py, and nothing else; the
rest of the uplink is the student's own microphone. This module imports no ORM
model and no database code, which is what makes that a property of the call
graph rather than a promise. If the interview is ever personalised, that path
goes through complete_chat(..., carries_student_data=True) in app/ai/llm.py and
degrades when the gate refuses — the same shape as /student/resume/generate
falling back to used_ai=false.

WHO OWNS THE TURN, STATED PLAINLY: **Nova owns the turn, this engine owns the
phase.** The retired v3 relay set `turn_detection.create_response: false` and
issued exactly one `response.create` from one call site, which made "one open
question at a time" a property of the call graph — read
docs/interview-engine-v3.md for why that mattered, because the reasoning
survives its engine. Nova 2 Sonic has no equivalent switch: it detects the end
of the student's speech and answers on its own, and that IS the product (its
turn-taking and its barge-in are the reason to use it). So the arc is steered
rather than driven:

  * the phase machine still ticks on ACCEPTED answers only, judged by the same
    deterministic `classify_answer` word gate as the local engine, so a
    student's scorecard is comparable whichever engine ran the interview;
  * a phase change reaches the model as a CONTROL NOTE — a cross-modal text
    input, the documented way to put text into a live Nova voice session —
    carrying only what changed, because Nova's system prompt is set once at the
    handshake and there is no `session.update` to replace it;
  * the two beats that must happen at a fixed point regardless of what the
    model would do next — "any questions for us?" and the closing verdict — are
    injected the same way;
  * a clarification is NOT injected. An engine that holds the turn can ask a
    too-short answer for more detail — the relay did, and the local engine still
    does; here the model has already started replying, and a second directive
    would produce a second question.
    The turn is still RECORDED as `too_short`/`filler`, which is the fact a
    mentor reads, and it still does not advance the arc.

THE SCORECARD IS A TOOL CALL. Nova speaks everything it generates, so the
relay's trick — one extra text-only response after the verdict — would have read
a JSON blob aloud to the student. Instead the session declares one tool,
`submit_scorecard`, and the closing control note asks the model to call it: the
arguments are the scorecard, they are never spoken, never written into the chat
history, and they are persisted whatever happens to them. The grading
instructions are `REPORT_DIRECTIVE` verbatim, shared with both other engines,
so the bar does not move with the transport.

THE 8-MINUTE WALL. A Nova bidirectional stream is closed by the service after 8
minutes, which is less than INTERVIEW_MAX_SECONDS (900). An interview that runs
into it ends mid-sentence with no verdict and no scorecard — the exact failure
the phase machine exists to prevent — so this engine treats
NOVA_SONIC_CONNECTION_SECONDS as the real cap and forces the wrap-up early
enough for the verdict and the scorecard to finish inside it.

Wire format downstream, unchanged from the engine this replaced:

    browser -> relay : BINARY = raw PCM16 LE mono 24 kHz
                       TEXT   = JSON control ({"type": "reep.end"}, ...)
    relay -> browser : BINARY = raw PCM16 LE mono 24 kHz (decoded)
                       TEXT   = JSON control

Upstream, Nova is fed 16 kHz by default (NOVA_SONIC_INPUT_RATE_HZ) because that
is the rate every AWS sample streams and the model is documented against; it
speaks 24 kHz, which is the browser's rate, so the downlink is never resampled.
