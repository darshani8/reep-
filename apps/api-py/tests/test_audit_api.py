"""B2.7 - the audit trail, read back.

`record_change` has been filling `redesign_audit_events` from twenty-seven
endpoints for months and nothing could read it but `psql`. These tests pin the
reader: who may open it, that a page is stable, that every filter narrows, that
the detail carries the before/after pair a list omits, that the download is
itself an event, and that both destructors still say KEEP for the table.

The claims are deliberately about BEHAVIOUR a person would notice. A trail that
repeats one row across two pages, or a CSV whose actor name runs as a formula
when the office opens it in Excel, or a download nobody can prove happened, are
each a way for an audit log to be present and useless.
