"""Mentor mapping — who mentors whom, who may change it, and what that leaves
behind (B9.1–B9.4).

WHY THIS IS ITS OWN MODULE. Every endpoint here was in `routers/console.py`,
which is 3 282 lines of programme-wide aggregates — criteria, alert rules, the
catalogue, the jobs sheet, three analytics endpoints, exports. Mentor mapping is
not an aggregate: it is the WRITE that decides rule 2's scope key. Moving a
student between faculty members changes who may read that student's marks,
attendance, USN, mentor notes and interview transcripts, and B9 adds a history
table, a 90-day handover grant and a per-department capacity to that act. Five
hundred and fifty lines of that filed under "console" is five hundred and fifty
lines nobody finds when they ask "where is mentor assignment decided" — and this
is the file where the answer has to be findable, because the next editor of it
is editing access control.

Same `/admin` prefix, same capabilities, same paths: this is a move, not a
redesign. The four endpoints are exactly the ones that were there —
`GET /mentor-load`, `GET /unassigned-students`, `POST /students/{id}/mentor`,
`GET /students/{id}/mentor-history` — plus the two helpers
(`ensure_mentor_group`, `_assert_same_college`) that `admin_students.py` imports
so the roster editor and the batch bar apply the same rules as the assignment
screen rather than their own.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT LIVES NEXT DOOR, AND WHY IT IS NOT IN HERE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`app/mentor_history.py` owns the history table and the handover grant: it is the
ONE writer of `mentor_assignments`, called by all five writers of
`students.mentor_id` (this module, two paths in `admin_students.py`, `app/seed.py`
and `app/grant_access.py`) and by `release_mentees_of`, which
`admin_faculty.disable_account` calls to unseat an offboarded faculty member's
mentees. `app/mentor_functions.py` names those five by count as a known hazard,
and the way a stored fact stays true is that there is one function that writes
it, not five call sites that each remember to.

CAPACITY IS ADVISORY AND NOTHING IN HERE READS IT. `departments.mentor_capacity`
makes the number settable per department instead of only in `.env`; it is
reported on the load board and no assignment endpoint consults it. See
`MentorLoadOut.capacity` for the argument, which is the owner's and predates
this phase.

    any faculty account the Main Admin grants it reaches this endpoint. That
    sentence mattered while the answer was the whole programme either way; with
    B1.4 it is the difference between a screen and a data leak, and a docstring
    that names the wrong gate is how the next reader decides no scope is needed
    here.

    SCOPED (B1.4). Faculty rows come from `reach.user_ids()` and mentee rows
    from `reach.student_ids()`, both narrowed in SQL. Narrowing only the faculty
    would have been the more obvious half and the wrong one: a mentor group can
    span departments (see `cross_department`), so a college admin reading a
    faculty member inside their college would otherwise read that faculty
    member's mentees in a college they hold nothing for.

    `?college_id=` and `?department_id=` narrow WITHIN the reach and cannot
    widen it: they are applied as additional predicates over the reach's own, so
    asking for a department the caller does not hold returns no rows rather than
    somebody else's. Re-validation is the shape of the query rather than a
    second check that could one day disagree with the first.

    Every MENTOR-role user is a row, including one who has never been assigned
    a student: that is the account the Main Admin needs to see in order to
    assign one, and until then `mentor_id` is null and rule 2 shows them
    nobody. A faculty account is not a mentor by existing; it becomes one when
    the office hands it a student.

    PAGED ONLY WHEN ASKED (B8.5). `?page_size=` opts in; without it every row
    the reach covers comes back, which is what the four screens reading this
    endpoint expect. The page is stated in `X-Reep-Total` / `X-Reep-Page` /
    `X-Reep-Page-Size` rather than in an envelope — see `PAGE_HEADER` above.
    The page is taken over the FACULTY rows, and the mentee queries are then

    the screen no faster, which is the only reason anyone asked for one."""
