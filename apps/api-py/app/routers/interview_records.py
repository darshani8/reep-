"""Interview records — the READ side, plus the consent grant (Interview Engine
v3 §7).

Two routers, one module:

  student_router  /api/interview/sessions[...]   the student's OWN interviews
                  /api/interview/consent          the caller's OWN grant
  staff_router    /api/mentor/students/{student_id}/interviews[...]

They are declared here with their FULL paths and both are included from
app/main.py with **no extra prefix**::

    app.include_router(interview_records.student_router)
    app.include_router(interview_records.staff_router)

That is the same shape app/routers/interview.py uses (`prefix="/api/interview"`)
and NOT the shape the domain routers use (`prefix="/mentor"` + `include_router(...,
prefix="/api")`). Mounting `staff_router` with `prefix="/api"` would silently
serve it at `/api/api/mentor/...`: every request 404s, nothing raises, and the
only symptom is a mentor screen that is permanently empty.

WHY A SECOND MODULE AND NOT THREE LINES IN mentor.py. `app/routers/mentor.py`
was being edited by another track while this landed, and a staff endpoint added
there would have collided with it. Declaring a second `/api/mentor` router costs
nothing — FastAPI merges routers by path, not by module — and it means the file
that owns AGENTS.md rule 2 is not touched by this feature at all.

RULE 2 IS THE POINT OF THIS MODULE, AND IT IS NOT RE-IMPLEMENTED HERE.
`_assert_can_access_student` is imported from `app/routers/mentor.py` — the one
implementation of "a MENTOR only for a student in their own group" — and called
as the FIRST LINE of every staff endpoint. app/routers/leave.py already
establishes both the precedent and the reasoning: a second copy here would be
the copy that stops tracking the first. A MENTOR with NO `Mentor` group lands in
that function's own 404 branch and sees NOBODY; that is the behaviour, and
nothing here adds to it, softens it, or works around it.

The gate takes the **path's** `student_id`. It does not, and cannot, say
anything about a session id, so every by-id staff endpoint does a SECOND check:
the row's own `student_id` must equal the path's. Gating on the path and then
loading a row by an id from somewhere else is a horizontal-privilege bug wearing
a correct-looking first line (§7.3).

The student endpoints take NO `student_id` — the subject comes from the session
cookie, the same way `POST /api/agent/ask` and `POST /api/voice/token` take
theirs. Adding one "for symmetry" would turn every student endpoint into an IDOR
the moment someone forgets a `.where()`.

404, NEVER 403, for a record that belongs to somebody else. `conversations.
assert_owner` already sets that rule: a 403 confirms that the id exists, which is
exactly what an enumeration wants to learn.

RULE 1 is not in play here. Nothing in this module talks to a model; it reads
rows that the relay already wrote.

    Changing what is acknowledged revokes the live row and inserts a new one,
    rather than updating the old row's booleans in place. That is the whole
    reason this is a table: `interview_sessions.consent_id` pins the exact grant
    that was live when an interview opened, so "was this student consented, to
    what, at the time of interview X" is answerable years later. Mutating a
    grant would rewrite the answer for every interview already pointing at it.

    THE SCOPES COME FROM THE POLICY, NEVER FROM THE REQUEST (B6.1). The client
    posts this at Start rather than from a form with three tick boxes; the
    server resolves `interview_policies` for this student's college and course
    and copies the two storage scopes onto the row. `scope_live_ai` is written
    TRUE and has no policy column, because it is not a switch a college owns:
    the interview IS a live AI conversation, so "no" to it is not an interview
    with a setting turned off, it is no interview — which is what not pressing
    Start already means. The column stays, and stays three, so that a reader a
    year from now can still see that this was disclosed.

    IT IS IDEMPOTENT, AND THAT IS LOAD-BEARING RATHER THAN TIDY. A live row for
    this version whose scopes already match the policy is RETURNED UNCHANGED —
    no supersede, no new row. Without that, a student pressing Start in a second
    tab would stamp `revoked_at` on the very row their running interview is
    pinned to, and `_make_heartbeat` would close that interview 4014 "Consent
    withdrawn" — a sentence they did not earn. With it, a supersede happens only
    when the policy has actually changed, which is precisely when the
    compatibility board says a running session may end.

    EXISTING ROWS KEEP WORKING. A grant written in 2026-08 from the old
    three-tick panel is live and this version's; it opens interviews exactly as
    before. It is superseded the first time its scopes disagree with the college
    policy, silently, at a Start the student was pressing anyway — which is the
    compat rule ("existing consent rows keep working for the running version")
    without a prompt anybody has to read twice.

    422 for a version this build does not know (§7.1). That is the one job a
    version string has: a stale cached SPA must not be able to acknowledge copy

# THERE IS NO `DELETE /api/interview/consent` ANY MORE, AND THE 405 IS THE POINT
# (B6.1).
#
# The route was a student withdrawing consent. What it withdrew — whether the
# transcript is kept, whether the audio is captured — is now the COLLEGE's
# decision, taken once in `interview_policies` for everybody on a course, and a
# button that appeared to let one student overrule it would be a promise the
# server does not keep. So the handler is DELETED rather than made to answer
# 403: `admin_students.py` set that precedent and stated the reason —
# "all three answer 405, never 403, because a capability refusal would mean the
# endpoint is still there waiting for a grant". A 405 says the operation does
# not exist here, which is true; a 403 would say it exists and you may not, which
# is not.
#
# 405 CANNOT BE ROLE-CONDITIONAL, whatever 04-backend-changes.md's wording
# suggests: the status comes from Starlette finding a path with no handler for
# the method, before any dependency runs. So it is 405 for everyone, which is
# the honest reading of "the policy is the college's" — a mentor and the Main
# Admin cannot withdraw a student's acknowledgement either, and neither could
# they before.
#
# WHAT THIS COSTS, WRITTEN DOWN: `revoked_at` used to be stamped from here, and
# `_make_heartbeat`'s 4014 watches for exactly that. The stamp now comes from
# `POST /consent` superseding a grant whose scopes no longer match the policy,
# and 4014 fires only when the superseding row covers LESS — see
# `routers/interview.py::_successor_covers`. Close 4013 and 4014 keep their
# meanings; what has gone is the one trigger a student could pull themselves.
#
# The rows are untouched. Nothing is deleted, every historical grant stays
# readable, and `GET /api/interview/consent` still answers what this account
# holds.

    `session["mentorId"]` predicate the mentees list uses, applied in SQL so an
    out-of-group interview never leaves the database.

    admits and which rows it returns. The capability-gated, scoped, paginated,

    gate, its 200-row runaway guard and the client that already calls it. Both

    Every other staff read in this module is placement business: a mentor needs
    their mentees' scores, transcript and history to do the job. A voice
    recording is not placement business. It exists so whoever operates this
    system can hear what the ENGINE did — a mis-transcribed turn, the
    interviewer talking over an answer — and that is an operator's artefact that
    happens to contain a named student speaking.

    So what reads it is the operator's capability, not the programme's role. A
    MENTOR gets 403 here and 200 everywhere else in this file, which is the
    intended asymmetry and not an oversight: widening this to require_mentor
    would hand the most sensitive bytes REEP stores to every faculty account,
    for no question they cannot already answer from the transcript.

    WHAT CHANGED (2026-09): the check is a CAPABILITY, not a role set. ADMIN
    holds it through ROLE_BASELINE, so nothing the office could do moved. It is
    the one capability a MENTOR does not get with the rest of the scoped set
    (app/governance.py), so the asymmetry above survives intact. What is new is
    that the Main Admin can grant it to a NAMED faculty member, with a reason,
    on the audit trail, for the one person who genuinely needs to hear a
    session — rather than the only options being "every mentor" or "nobody".
    The 403 names the capability and where to ask for it, instead of being a
    dead end.

    THE ROLE THIS PARAGRAPH USED TO BE ABOUT IS GONE (2026-09-10). It argued
    the same asymmetry for DIRECTOR, which held every other capability by
    baseline and this one only by grant. DIRECTOR now holds NOTHING at all, so
    that reading is not merely stale, it is false in the direction that matters:
    it would tell you a DIRECTOR reads transcripts here, and it does not read
    anything. The argument was always about operator-versus-programme, never
    about that particular role, so it transfers to MENTOR unchanged.

# refused to hide the SCORE because the model already speaks its verdict aloud,

# about, leaving "a secret file on a student" — the one arrangement here that
# would be hard to defend. Audio inverts every term of that argument:
#
#   * It tells the student nothing they do not have. They were there; the
#     transcript is already theirs, turn by turn, and it is the artefact that
#     helps them practise. A waveform of their own voice adds no information
#     about how they did.
#   * It is not a judgement about them, so there is nothing to be "kept from"
#     them. The recording exists so an authorised developer can hear what the
#     ENGINE did — why a turn was mis-transcribed, why the interviewer talked
#     over an answer — which is a debugging artefact that happens to contain a
#     student's voice.
#   * A student endpoint is the widest possible surface for the most sensitive
#     bytes REEP holds. Any live student session — a shared lab machine, a
#     borrowed laptop, a tab left signed in — would stream a named person's
#     voice on request. Every recording is reachable through exactly one role

    with both voices on one timeline, the way a phone recording sounds, because
    that is what somebody reviewing an interview actually plays. It is DERIVED:
    the recorder sums the two per-speaker tracks at close, having padded each to
    the session's wall clock so they line up (app/interview_audio.py's header
    sets out what that alignment can and cannot promise).

    `?track=student` AND `?track=interviewer` KEEP WORKING, unchanged, and they
    are still the faithful record — the student's is what their microphone
    captured, the interviewer's is exactly what was forwarded to the browser.
    Reach for them when the question is "what did the model actually send", and
    do NOT delete them as duplicates of the mix: the mix is regenerable from
    them and they are not recoverable from it.

    An earlier revision of this docstring said the two must never be mixed. That
    was correct about the files it described — before the timeline existed each
    track was a speech-only concatenation, so laying them side by side put
    answers under the wrong questions. The mix is honest now because the padding
    made it so, not because the objection was waved off.

    404 — never 403 and never 204 — for a session with no recording, so an
    admin cannot tell "this interview was not recorded" from "that is not a
    real id"; the same no-existence-leak rule the rest of this module follows.

# rows name students and carry scores. `carries_pii` means B2.4's second

    rows in it next September when the sessions themselves are gone. Both fences
    are applied here in the same order and for the same reasons; the one thing
    that must never happen is for this to grow a THIRD idea of who may be in a
    file that cannot be recalled.

    """The interviews extract — SUMMARY ROWS ONLY, and that is B14's rule here.

    NOT ONE WORD ANYBODY SAID LEAVES IN THIS FILE. No transcript, no strengths,
    no improvements, no `drill`, no `summary` sentence and above all no
    `raw_response` — the model's private reasoning about a student, which does
    not travel to the student themselves and certainly does not travel in a
    spreadsheet. What leaves is what `interview_score_summaries` holds: a date,
    a track, a status and four integers. An export is the one thing in REEP that
    cannot be recalled (`app/exports.py`), and the narrowest useful file is the
    right one.

    IT READS THE SUMMARIES, NOT THE SESSIONS, for B6.2's reason: this is the
    table that survives retention, so an extract taken in September still
    contains March, which is precisely when somebody asks for it.

    THE THREE B14 RULES APPLY UNCHANGED and none of them are re-implemented
    here: `scope_filter` decides who may be in the file, `carries_personal_
    columns` decides whether it may name them, and `record_export` leaves the
    receipt. The receipt commits and a failure to write it FAILS the download —
    that asymmetry with `_log_record_view` above is deliberate and
    `app/exports.py` argues it.

    `?recorded_only=` IS ABSENT AND THAT IS NOT AN OVERSIGHT: whether a
    recording exists is a fact about the session, and this file is built from
    the summaries, which outlive it. A filter that silently meant "only the
    interviews not yet reaped" would be a filter that changes its answer every
    night at 02:00.
