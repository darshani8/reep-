"""Setting the first password, forgetting it, and changing it.

Three flows, one ending: THE THING THAT LET YOU IN IS DESTROYED. An activation
link is consumed; a reset link is consumed and every other device is signed
out; a change keeps this device and signs out the rest. Logging the other
devices out after a reset matters because the commonest reason for a reset is
that somebody else got in.

STUDENTS COME HERE NOW (2026-09-10). Option B — students sign in with Google
and hold no password — was reversed: a student sets a password at the end of
`routers/onboarding.py`, so `forgot` and `change-password` serve them like
anyone else. Two refusals survive the reversal and are NOT vestigial:
`activate` still refuses a STUDENT, because an activation link is a STAFF
first-password link and a student's equivalent is the onboarding walk, which
proves the mailbox with a code first; and both flows still refuse an account
holding the unusable sentinel, which is an account that has not finished
onboarding rather than one with a forgotten password. The password door itself
is still `password_door_open` in auth.py — the first real scrypt hash opens it,
and the first one is now usually a student's.

AND `activate` REFUSES AN ACCOUNT THAT ALREADY HOLDS ONE (B3.4). A first-password
link that also works as a change-password link is an account takeover wearing a
support action's clothes: the Main Admin can re-mint an activation link for
anybody, so whoever held that link could set a new password on a live faculty
account. It answers 410 and names "Forgot password?", which mails the ACCOUNT.

WHY A SEPARATE MODULE. auth.py is 830 lines and owns sign-in; this owns
credentials. It borrows auth's session issuance rather than copying it, so a
change to the cookie is still one edit.

NEVER SAY WHETHER AN ADDRESS EXISTS. `forgot` answers the same words with the
same status whether the account is real, Google-only, or unknown, and does the
mail work in a background task so the response returns at the same moment in
every case. Otherwise the form is a free tool for discovering who is enrolled.

`forgot` IS ALSO HOW A PASSWORD-LESS STUDENT GETS THEIR FIRST PASSWORD
(2026-09-16). A student whose account holds the unusable sentinel - every
account `app.seed_roster` and `app.grant_access` mint, and every student
provisioned before 2026-09-10 under option B - could sign in with Google and
reach a password by NO path at all: this endpoint skipped them in silence,
`change-password` answered 409 and named "the link you were emailed", which
they never were, and the console has no button for it. From the student's
side that was "I typed the right address and the code never came". So a
STUDENT in that state is now mailed the SETUP link (`issue_password_setup`,
the same `/onboard` walk provisioning sends: address, code, password) rather
than nothing. The answer on screen is still one sentence for every address.
STAFF holding the sentinel are still sent nothing here: their first password
is the activation link their admin holds and can read out on the phone.
