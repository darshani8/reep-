"""B2.1 — every capability in the catalogue is checked, or it is not there.

Fourteen of the twenty-nine keys `CAPABILITIES` declared were checked at zero
call sites. That is not a gap in coverage; it is a governance screen offering
switches connected to nothing. The office grants one, types a reason, the audit
records the act, `/auth/me` reports the key back — and the API refuses exactly
as much as it did before.

This module pins the three decisions B2.1 made, one test each:

  * the ten `student.*` keys were DELETED, because nothing checked them and
    nothing ever had (the student-facing half of those names lives on as
    FeatureOverrides, which is a different instrument with the opposite default);
  * `mentor.notebook` REPLACED a role gate, because composing it with one that
    admits MENTOR only would have left the Main Admin's grant inert — a key that
    is checked but can never be satisfied is the same lie one layer in;
  * `mentor.leave_approve` COMPOSED with one, because the approver's queue must
    stay staff-only whatever a grant says, and because the SUBMIT path must keep
    working for a faculty member with no mentees;
  * `mentor.agent` sits behind a ROLE BRANCH, because a student reaches the
    agent every day and holds no capability at all.

`tests/test_codebase_guards.py` §34 is the other half: it proves the catalogue
has no unchecked key left, so these behaviours cannot be quietly un-wired.
