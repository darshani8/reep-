/**
 * SWOC notes — the board at docs/redesign-2026-09/design/admin/Swoc.html
 * (02-admin-console-spec.md §18), on `/admin/swoc`.
 *
 *     Strengths · Weaknesses · Opportunities · Challenges
 *
 * One list of students, one editor of four quadrants. `GET /admin/swoc` is
 * every student with every entry written about them (the list IS the data —
 * picking a row fills the editor with no second read). `POST /admin/swoc/{id}`,
 * `PATCH` and `DELETE /admin/swoc/entries/{id}` do the writing. The route is
 * `capabilityGuard('admin.swoc')` and the API `require_capability` on the same
 * key, so a faculty member granted it in Governance reaches this screen with
 * nothing else changing.
 *
 * THE VIEWPOINT IS NOT A FIELD HERE. The API stamps it, and B7 made that stamp
 * mean something: MENTOR is written only when the author actually mentors THAT
 * student, so one granted lecturer no longer files every line on a department's
 * board as MENTOR about students they have never met. The editor only shows it,
 * as a chip.
 *
 * A LINE BELONGS TO WHOEVER WROTE IT (B7.2). The author edits and deletes their
 * own; the Main Admin edits any; an authorless line is the office's alone,
 * because treating "no author" as "everybody is the author" makes exactly the
 * rows nobody is answerable for the easiest to rewrite. The server answers 403
 * with a sentence saying so, and this screen prints that sentence rather than
 * pre-disabling the box: the response carries the author's NAME and not their
 * id, so a client guess would have to match on a name, and two colleagues who
 * share one would each be told the other's lines are theirs.
 *
 * THE DEPARTMENT PILL IS A READ-OUT, NOT A FILTER (B1.4). `GET /admin/swoc` is
 * scoped — `scope_filter` narrows the students AND their entries to the
 * caller's grant — and it takes no department parameter: the reach is stated on
 * the response instead, in `X-Reep-Scope` with `X-Reep-Scope-Colleges` and
 * `X-Reep-Scope-Departments` beside it. A picker was the wrong shape twice
 * over: there is nothing to send, and a row here carries no department to
 * filter on client-side either (`SwocStudentRow` is student, USN, batch and the
 * entries), so a menu could only have hidden students without saying why. What
 * the pill does instead is state how far the grant reaches, which is the
 * question the board's filter was really asking.
 *
 * AND "REACHES NOBODY" IS NOT "NOBODY IS ENROLLED". A grant whose only target
 * was a deleted department answers `[]`, exactly as a fresh deployment does.
 * The empty list says which of the two it is looking at, because on this screen
 * the first is a governance problem for one account and the second is a fact
 * about the college.
 *
 * WHAT THE BOARD DRAWS THAT NO ENDPOINT ANSWERS. Two things, and both are
 * plainly `disabled` with the real reason in a `title` and NO phase number on
 * them — the treatment `45b91a9` gave the Faculty screen's orphan controls,
 * because a phase number beside a control nothing is bringing is a promise the
 * product does not keep. The MENTOR filter: `SwocStudentRow` carries no mentor
 * and `GET /admin/swoc` takes no mentor parameter, so a menu here could only
 * hide students without saying why. The EXPORT: there is no SWOC CSV anywhere
 * in the API — `/admin/exports/` serves students, placement and the ledger, and
 * nothing serves written notes about named students as a file.
