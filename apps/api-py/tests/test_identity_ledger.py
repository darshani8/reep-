"""The identity ledger's shape, pinned without a database.

`app/export_identity.py` writes the one file that is meant to outlive every
schema this product will ever have, so the properties that make it replayable
are properties a test has to assert rather than a docstring has to promise.
Everything here runs on a hand-built row: the query needs Postgres, the SHAPE
does not, and the shape is the part with a ten-year contract.
