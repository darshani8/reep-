"""Interview Engine v3 §6.5/§6.7 — the record write path, and the ways it can
lie without anyone noticing.

Everything here defends against the same class of failure, the one the AGENTS.md
voice runbook was written about: the interview sounded fine in the room and the
database disagrees. Under v3 there are now TWO records of a turn -- the
`messages` row every other channel writes, and the `interview_turns` row that
carries the phase, the transcription status and whether the turn advanced the arc
-- and the entire value of the second is being trustworthy when the first cannot
be. A writer that can leave them disagreeing about which turns happened would
have no value at all, so:

  * both inserts share ONE transaction, and a duplicate rolls BOTH back;
  * a blank transcript keeps its interview_turns row and skips only `messages`
    (L4) -- those are precisely the turns `transcription_status` exists for, and
    dropping them would leave the new column with nothing to say;
  * `append_message` refusing (ConversationGone, L5) ends the interview instead
    of dropping one turn per turn for the rest of a fifteen-minute session;
  * every session reaches a terminal status, through whichever of the three
    finalization layers gets there first, because a row stuck at `running` is a
    record that lies.

Plus audit H1's per-user concurrency cap, which is pure logic and needs no
database at all.

The database-backed tests own every row they touch and tear it down; the pure
ones use a fake browser socket, a fake writer and no Postgres.
