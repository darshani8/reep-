"""The question bank behind the free-style interviewer, and the bulk parser.

Two jobs, both small on purpose:

  question_bank_for(track)   -> the enabled questions of one track, in order,
                                rendered as the "[phase] text" lines that
                                interview_matrix.build_instructions expects
                                (the same shape the voice platform renders)
  with_question_bank(spec)   -> a Specialization carrying that bank, for the
                                interview router to hand the engine

Resolved LIVE on every socket open, never cached: a question an admin adds this
morning is asked this afternoon, and a per-process cache is how a deleted
question keeps being asked on three of five workers until the next deploy. It is
one indexed SELECT; the router runs it off the event loop.

The bulk parser is here rather than in the router so the same rules apply to a
pasted list and to a file, and so they can be tested without a request.
