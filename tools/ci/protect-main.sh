#
# protect-main.sh — put the gate on `main` that this repository does not have.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Every mechanical control in this repo is advisory today, and
# all of them for the same single cause:
#
#     $ gh api repos/darshani8/reep-/branches/main/protection
#     404  "Branch not protected"
#     $ gh api repos/darshani8/reep-/rulesets
#     []
#
# CI has four jobs and they are good jobs — a real Postgres, REEP_REQUIRE_DB=1
# so a silently skipped DB test is a failure, a dependency-completeness check
# per manifest, a production Angular build against the bundle budget. None of
# them can stop anything. `git push origin main` writes to the default branch
# and CI finds out afterwards. Delete the `if not mentor_id` branch in
# apps/api-py/app/routers/mentor.py and tests/test_mentee_records.py goes red —
# and the push lands anyway, and from that moment every MENTOR reads every
# student's marks, attendance and USN. That is rule 2 of AGENTS.md, defended by
# a test that nothing is obliged to run.
#
# This script closes that. It is the one control the rest of the process hangs
# off: the PR template, CONTRIBUTING.md, the pre-commit hooks and CODEOWNERS are
# all conventions, and a convention on an unprotected branch is a note taped to
# an open door.
#
# RUN STEP 1 OF THE PROCESS FIRST — the two-line `cancel-in-progress` fix in
# .github/workflows/ci.yml. ci.yml currently cancels an in-flight run on EVERY
# ref including main, and a `cancelled` check is neither success nor failure: it
# never resolves. Turn on required checks before that fix and main wears a
# permanently amber check, which reads as a flake, and the first person blocked
# by it goes looking for the bypass. AGENTS.md says the same thing about the
# ENV=prod boot guard — a guard that trips on a laptop gets deleted by whoever
# is trying to ship that afternoon. Order matters here for exactly that reason.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE APPROVAL DECISION IS YOURS, AND IT IS A REAL TRADE. READ THIS.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The default below requires 1 approving review AND applies the rules to
# administrators. On a repository with one collaborator — `gh api
# repos/darshani8/reep-/collaborators` returns exactly one account — those two
# settings together mean YOU CANNOT MERGE YOUR OWN PULL REQUEST. GitHub does not
# let an author approve their own PR, and enforce_admins removes the override
# you would otherwise reach for. There is no third setting that fixes this. Pick
# one of two honest options:
#
#   (a) Keep it. Every merge needs a second human or a second account. This is
#       the right answer the day a second maintainer exists, and it is the only
#       configuration in which "reviewed" means a person other than the author
#       read the diff. The friction is the feature; it is also real, and on a
#       solo repo it is friction with nobody on the other side of it.
#
#   (b) Drop to zero approvals:  ./tools/ci/protect-main.sh --approvals 0
#       You still cannot push to main. You still cannot merge red. Every change
#       still goes branch -> PR -> four green checks -> merge, and the checks are
#       what actually verify anything. What you give up is the second pair of
#       eyes, which on a solo repo you did not have anyway. This is the setting
#       that gets USED, and a used gate beats an unused one that was switched off
#       on a Friday.
#
# A third option that is NOT the default here: leaving admins exempt while
# requiring an approval. That configuration reads as protected and behaves as
# unprotected for the only account that can push, which is the worst of the
# three. The escape hatch exists as --allow-admin-bypass so that taking it is a
# deliberate act with a flag name that says what it does.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE STATUS CHECK NAMES ARE STRINGS, AND THAT IS THE SHARP EDGE.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GitHub matches a required status check by the DISPLAY NAME of the job — the
# `name:` field in .github/workflows/ci.yml, not the job's YAML key (`api`,
# `api-imports`, `worker-imports`, `web`). The four strings in REQUIRED_CHECKS
# below must match those `name:` values byte for byte: spaces, parentheses and
# capitalisation included.
#
# The failure mode is silent, and it is why this script greps ci.yml before it
# calls the API. Rename "Web (Angular)" to "Web (Angular 20)" in an otherwise
# ordinary PR and: the PR reports a passing "Web (Angular 20)", the required
# "Web (Angular)" is never reported at all, and a required check that has never
# been reported on a branch is a check GitHub has nothing to wait for. The job
# still runs. The job still goes green. It has simply stopped being a gate, and
# nothing anywhere says so — the required-check list lives in a settings pane
# that no pull request reviews. A renamed job does not fail. It retires.
#
# So: rename a job and re-run this script in the same change. The pre-flight
# check below turns "you renamed a gate" into an error today instead of a gap
# discovered three months from now.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT USES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# It applies CLASSIC branch protection (`PUT /repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/
# {branch}/protection`), because that endpoint is a single idempotent full-state
# PUT: re-running it converges rather than accumulating, which is what makes it
# safe to run from a runbook by someone who cannot remember whether it was run
# last month. Rulesets are the newer mechanism, and .github/rulesets/main.json
# is the committed record of the equivalent configuration. If you apply BOTH,
# know that GitHub evaluates both and the MOST RESTRICTIVE wins — they do not
# override one another, and a rule you "removed" from one can still be live in
# the other. Choose one as the source of truth and say which in SECURITY.md.
#
# Usage:
#   ./tools/ci/protect-main.sh                 # show the plan, ask, apply
#   ./tools/ci/protect-main.sh --dry-run       # print the exact payload, send nothing
#   ./tools/ci/protect-main.sh --yes           # non-interactive (runbook, CI)
#   ./tools/ci/protect-main.sh --approvals 0   # option (b) above
#   ./tools/ci/protect-main.sh --show          # print current protection and exit
#
# Requires: gh >= 2.0, authenticated with ADMIN on the repository.
#   classic PAT   -> scope `repo` (plus `admin:org` for an org-owned repo)
#   fine-grained  -> Repository permissions -> Administration: Read and write
