/**
 * Interview question bank — /admin/interview-questions.
 *
 * Board: docs/redesign-2026-09/design/admin/InterviewBank.html
 * Spec:  docs/redesign-2026-09/02-admin-console-spec.md §16
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT: a script. The interviewer stays free-style; these rows
 * become its "guide to coverage" — worked in, in this order, at the phase in
 * brackets, rephrased naturally, with follow-ups on what the student says. An
 * admin decides WHAT is covered, the model decides HOW it is asked.
 *
 * WHAT IS LIVE HERE, and it is the whole existing surface:
 * `/api/admin/interview-questions` — `/tracks`, the list, POST, `/bulk`,
 * PATCH, DELETE and `/reorder`. Search, the column and density choices and the
 * page size are all done over rows already loaded, so they need no endpoint of
 * their own.
 *
 * THERE IS NO EXPORT BUTTON ON THIS GRID, and that is deliberate: the board
 * draws Columns and Density and nothing else, and 02-admin-console-spec.md §22
 * makes every extract a card on the Exports screen, behind `admin.exports`,
 * carrying a PII flag and an audited download history. A client-side CSV built
 * from the rows in view hands the same data out from a screen gated on
 * `admin.interview_questions`, with no audit row and no flag — it routes around
 * the control §22 exists to impose. An extract of this bank belongs there.
 *
 * A TRACK IS A ROW NOW. `/api/admin/interview-questions/tracks` is a full
 * GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE surface behind the same `admin.interview_questions`
 * key, so the persona, the frameworks, the voice, the sample question, the
 * syllabus and whether the track is offered at all are edited here. Four things
 * about it are load-bearing and none of them are visible at the call site:
 *
 *   · A CODE WITH NO ROW IS STILL LISTED, with `source: 'code'` and `id: null`.
 *     It is the constant in `app/interview_matrix.py`, `resolve_specialization`
 *     still falls back to it, and it is running interviews right now — so it is
 *     shown, and shown as not editable, rather than hidden or offered a PATCH
 *     with no id to send.
 *   · THE VOICE IS A CLOSED SET. Nova answers an unknown `voiceId` with a
 *     ValidationException that kills the stream during the handshake — an
 *     interview that never starts, for every student on the track, with nothing
 *     on any screen naming the cause. The field is a `<select>` over
 *     `KNOWN_NOVA_VOICES` for that reason and not for tidiness; the server
 *     refuses the same set, and this is the half that stops it being typed.
 *   · THE PERSONA IS A NOUN PHRASE. `build_instructions` embeds it as "you are
 *     {persona}", so a trailing full stop composes into "you are a sharp CFO.."
 *     and an imperative composes into nonsense. The server refuses both; the
 *     help text under the field is what stops an admin meeting that refusal.
 *   · A USED TRACK IS RETIRED, NEVER DELETED. `interview_sessions` files every
 *     interview under the track CODE, so deleting a used row orphans a cohort's
 *     records from their own track. The server refuses it and the card offers
 *     the checkbox instead.
 *
 * THE SESSION CAP IS NOT ON THIS SCREEN. A cap is not a property of a track:
 * the time limit and the daily and attempt ceilings are `interview_policies`,
 * one row per (college, course), edited on Interview records.
 *
 * THERE IS NO "ASKED" OR "AVG SCORE" COLUMN (2026-09-15). Both were drawn and
 * both read a permanent dash with a tooltip saying why: attributing a turn to
 * the question that produced it (B6.6) was examined in Phase 4 and found
 * impossible without scripting the interview, because the interviewer works
 * the bank in freely and rephrases. A column that can never hold a number is
 * the grey control the owner's rule for the console refuses, so the two went,
 * and the column chooser and density toggle whose only job was to hide them
 * went with them. The reasoning stays here; if the column ever comes back it
 * will be as an ESTIMATE the screen labels as one.
 *
 * ONE COLUMN, TOP TO BOTTOM (2026-09-15). The 290px track rail is a row of
 * pill tabs, and under it come one card for the track and one for its
 * questions; the add-one and add-many forms open inside the questions card
 * rather than as cards of their own. Every control the board had is here;
 * what left is the help text under each field (the placeholder carries the
 * example instead), the footnote and the duplicate "Add many" button.
 *
 * Reached by the `admin.interview_questions` capability: the Main Admin by
 * baseline, a mentor only when granted — which is how faculty are given this.
