"""Delete every STUDENT from this deployment: ``python -m app.purge_students``.

The narrow counterpart to `app.purge_people`, for the case that actually comes
up. A demonstration cohort has to go; the faculty who were set up alongside it,
their signatures, their upskilling shelf, their governance grants and the
institution itself all have to stay. `app.purge_people` cannot express that —
its verdicts are whole-table (`students: EMPTY`, `users: SURVIVOR`), so it keeps
the Main Admin and nobody else, and running it to clear a cohort deletes every
faculty account on the way through.

WHAT GOES: every account whose role is STUDENT, every row those accounts
produced, every row any staff member wrote ABOUT them (mentor notes, SWOC
entries, the mentor notebook), and the documents, interview audio and call
recordings behind all of it.

AND EVERY FORMER STUDENT, BUT ONLY IF ASKED (`--include-graduates`). Since B4.4
a graduate is an ALUMNI account that still owns its `students` row, and that
pulls the module's two halves apart: `users` is scoped by ROLE, so the account
survives, while `students` and the thirty tables under it are verdict `ALL`, so
the whole academic record is emptied out from under it. A login with nothing
behind it, silently, on a module whose entire claim is that it knows who each
row belongs to. So `_refuse_unless_every_student_row_is_doomed` REFUSES the run
the moment a `students` row belongs to an account this pass is not deleting,
names the accounts, and stops before a byte is destroyed. `--include-graduates`
is the answer to that refusal and it is a wider act, not a workaround: it adds
every account that owns a `students` row WHATEVER ITS ROLE, so a graduate goes
completely — account, alumni profile, record — because they were a student on
this deployment. An ALUMNI account that never was one (a guest speaker, the
seeded `alumni@bgscet.ac.in`) owns no `students` row and is not touched by
either mode.

WHAT STAYS: every MENTOR, ALUMNI and ADMIN account untouched, their own
records, the institutional hierarchy, the catalogues, the job postings and the
Knowledge Base — everything `app.purge_people` keeps, plus the people it would
have deleted.

**The properties that make it safe to point at production are the same three,
plus one this module needs and `purge_people` does not.**

FIRST, EVERY TABLE HAS A WRITTEN VERDICT — and here a verdict is not two
values but three, because "delete the student rows" is a different sentence in
a table only a student can own (`resumes`) and in a table shared with staff
(`leave_requests`). `STUDENT_VERDICTS` below says which, for all 93 tables, and
an unclassified table ABORTS THE RUN exactly as it does next door. The key set
is checked against `purge_people.VERDICTS`, so the next person to add a model
is stopped by BOTH destructors rather than by the one they happened to read.

SECOND, THE FILES GO BEFORE THE ROWS, for `purge_people`'s reason — a row is
the last pointer to a student's resume and a named student's recorded voice,
and a delete that loses the pointer first leaves bytes nobody can find. The
three stores are destroyed through `purge_people`'s own functions, handed the
subset of rows this purge is taking, never a copy of the logic.

THIRD, IT REFUSES TO TOUCH A NON-STUDENT. The doomed set is `role == STUDENT`
and nothing else, plus — under `--include-graduates`, and only there — the
accounts that own a `students` row, each one read back and proved rather than
taken on the word of the query that selected it. `_refuse_unless_only_students`
checks all of that against the database BEFORE a single byte is destroyed,
because the one way this module could be catastrophic is a scope predicate that
is wrong about who a row belongs to, and that mistake must surface while it is
still only a refusal.
After the deletes it is checked AGAIN, inside the transaction, so a wrong
verdict on some other table that took an account with it rolls the whole pass
back instead of committing it.

FOURTH — the one `purge_people` has no need of — THE STUDENT'S APPLICATION GOES
WITH THE STUDENT. `registrations` is the only table here holding rows for people
who are not yet anybody, and the office's pending queue must survive a cohort
being cleared. So it is scoped, not emptied: an application that was APPROVED
(it became a student) or that carries a doomed account's address goes; a pending
or rejected application from someone who never became a student stays where the
admin left it. Leaving an approved application behind would be worse than untidy
— `POST /api/register`'s duplicate guard would then refuse that address forever,
and the person it refuses has no account any more to explain why.

DRY RUN IS THE DEFAULT. `--apply` is the only thing that deletes, and the counts
a dry run prints are the counts the real pass acts on.

    `_refuse_unless_only_students` asks "is every account we are deleting a
    student". This asks the question in the other direction — "is every student
    RECORD we are deleting owned by an account we are deleting" — and it exists
    because since B4.4 the answer can be no.

    Graduation flips `users.role` to ALUMNI and leaves the `students` row where
    it is, on purpose: the row is the record of what that person did here. But
    `STUDENT_VERDICTS["students"]` is `ALL` and `users` is `ACCOUNTS`, so a pass
    that selects on role deletes the record and keeps the login. Nothing else
    would notice: the account is not in `doomed.user_ids`, so the survivor count
    in `execute` matches, `_refuse_unless_only_students` passes, and the run
    commits a graduate with no marks, no interviews, no uploads and no badges.

    Verdict changes were the alternative and were rejected. Scoping the thirty
    `ALL` tables by a doomed-student-id set is the eventually-right answer and
    is a thirty-line diff through tables that reach `students` only through a
    parent (`subject_marks`, `time_ledger_cells`, `english_baseline_sections`);
    every one of those lines is a chance to leave a student's rows behind, which
    is the failure this module is least able to detect. `ALL` is correct exactly
    when every `students` row is going, so this makes that TRUE instead — by
    refusing when it is not, and by offering `--include-graduates` for the
    operator who means it.

    WHAT A COHORT PURGE NOW DOES TO A GRADUATE, in one sentence each:
      * by default it REFUSES, names them, and deletes nothing at all;
      * with `--include-graduates` it deletes them completely — the ALUMNI
        account, the `alumni_profiles` row, and the whole academic record —
        because they were a student on this deployment and that is what this
        module is for.
    There is deliberately no third behaviour in which some of a person's rows
    go and the rest stay.
