/**
 * My account — one screen for the login the person signed in with.
 *
 * Board: docs/redesign-2026-09/design/admin/Account.html
 * Spec:  docs/redesign-2026-09/02-admin-console-spec.md §24
 *
 * EVERY ROLE REACHES THIS, from the avatar menu, so nothing here may assume a
 * console. The panels hide themselves where they do not apply rather than
 * rendering a control that answers 403: a STUDENT and an ALUMNUS have no
 * signature (`/api/staff/signature` is `require_mentor`), so that card is not
 * drawn for them at all.
 *
 * THE PASSWORD PANEL IS DERIVED, NOT ASSUMED, and the derivation is the same
 * one the server makes. `password_door_open(db)` in app/routers/auth.py is
 * dev/CI always, `PASSWORD_LOGIN=true` always, `PASSWORD_LOGIN=false` never,
 * and otherwise open exactly when some account holds a real `scrypt:` hash —
 * and `GET /api/auth/sso/status` publishes that one bit as
 * `password_login_available`. So when the server says the door is SHUT, this
 * account holds no usable password either (no key exists anywhere, or keys are
 * forced off), and the honest screen is a sentence about Google rather than a
 * change-password form that cannot succeed. When it says OPEN the bit is about
 * the deployment and not about this row — accounts minted by `grant_access` and
 * `seed_roster` hold the SSO_ONLY sentinel — so the only per-account truth is
 * the 409 `POST /auth/change-password/code` answers, and that swaps the form
 * for the same sentence the moment it arrives. There is STILL no endpoint that
 * says "does THIS account hold a password": B15 put `google_linked`,
 * `last_sign_ins` and `notification_prefs` on `/auth/me` and nothing about the
 * password, so that 409 remains the only per-account truth.
 *
 * ONE PROOF, NEVER TWO. `/auth/change-password` takes the emailed code or the
 * current password and refuses both together (`_authorised_to_change`). This
 * screen offers the CODE, like `/account/password` does: a student who set
 * their first password last week does not reliably remember it, and the code
 * proves the mailbox is readable now. The current-password path stays the
 * API's, for staff and for the tests; it is not a second form here.
 *
 * B15 AND B3.6 HAVE LANDED, so the four controls this screen drew disabled are
 * live: the Google link state and `POST /auth/google/unlink`, the recent
 * sign-ins, the notification switches (`PUT /auth/notification-prefs`) and
 * `POST /auth/sign-out-everywhere`. `PendingControlDirective` is gone from this
 * component with them.
 *
 * ALL THREE READS ARRIVE ON ONE CALL. `google_linked`, `last_sign_ins` and
 * `notification_prefs` ride on `GET /api/auth/me` — the call `AuthService`
 * already owns — so this screen adds no endpoint of its own and its "refresh"
 * is `AuthService.refresh()`. A second raw `fetch` of `/auth/me` here would
 * paint the right numbers over a session signal the rest of the app reads and
 * would then be holding the old ones.
 *
 * `google_linked` IS `bool | null` AND THE NULL IS LOAD-BEARING. Only `/me`
 * answers it; `/login` mints the same model and leaves it null. A client that
 * reads absent as `false` tells somebody their Google sign-in is unlinked on
 * the screen immediately after they used it, so "not asked" is its own
 * rendering here and never "not linked".
 *
 * WHAT THE BOARD STILL DRAWS THAT NO ENDPOINT ANSWERS is the digest FREQUENCY
 * per topic (daily / weekly / immediately) and the five topics beside it, and
 * "All events". The catalogue behind `notification_prefs` holds exactly one
 * switch and it is on or off, so the card says that rather than drawing five
 * dropdowns over one boolean; and `/me` carries the last ten sign-ins, which is
 * the whole list REEP keeps for a person, so the button beside it re-reads that
 * list instead of promising a longer one. Neither is a disabled control with a
 * phase on it, because no phase adds them: a "Available with Phase N" that
 * names no phase is the same lie as a dead button.

   *  out everywhere" would then have an exception in it — the one sentence

   *  make next is a 401, so it takes the app's ordinary signed-out path — clear
   *  the session the service holds, go to `/login` — exactly as "Sign out"
   *  above does. `auth.logout()` is idempotent and reads the cookie optionally,
   *  so posting it against the cookie the server has just deleted is a no-op
   *  that clears the signal, and a failure there must still not strand anybody
   *  on a dead screen.
   *
   *  Confirmed first, because it is the only button here that ends a session
   *  the person cannot see — and the reason they reach for it (a shared lab
   *  machine, a phone that was taken) is the reason it must not be a slip. */
