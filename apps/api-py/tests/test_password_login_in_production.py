"""Password sign-in outside dev/CI: the flag, the limiter, and the key issuer.

Three rules, and each one fails in a way nothing else would report.

THE FLAG IS AN OPT-IN, NOT A CONSEQUENCE OF ENV. `password_login_allowed` used
to be exactly `_is_dev_env(env)`, and the temptation when opening this door is
to relax it to `not is_prod` — which silently opens `staging`, `uat`, `demo` and
every typo, on boxes that hold real roster rows. The tests below pin that an
unrecognised ENV stays SHUT unless the flag positively says otherwise, which is
the same fail-closed shape the cookie's `Secure` guard uses.

THE LIMITER IS KEYED ON THE ACCOUNT AND NOT THE ADDRESS. An address bucket
behind an ALB is one bucket for the whole internet, so ten wrong passwords from
anyone would lock out every student at once. That is not a hypothetical: it was
written that way first and the suite went from 24 failures to 134, because every
TestClient request shares one peer address. `test_a_failure_for_one_account_does_
not_lock_out_another` is that regression, pinned.

A PASSWORD MUST BE ISSUED DELIBERATELY. Opening the door does not give anybody a
key: accounts minted by grant_access/seed_roster hold the SSO-only sentinel, and
app.set_password is the only way past it. If that ever silently accepts a short
or published password, the door and the key are both weak at once.
