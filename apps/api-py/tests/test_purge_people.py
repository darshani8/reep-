"""The production purge: everyone but the Main Admin, and everything they did.

The load-bearing test here is `test_the_delete_order_survives_every_foreign_key`,
and it is written the way it is on purpose. `app.purge_people` is correct only
if its delete order satisfies 182 real foreign keys — several of which carry no
ON DELETE clause at all (`login_days.user_id`, `mentors.user_id`,
`students.user_id`, and the four `created_by_user_id` columns on the
institutional spine, which point at rows that are about to be deleted from
tables that are being KEPT). A synthetic fixture graph would prove the order
against the constraints somebody remembered to reproduce. So instead the test
runs the REAL delete against the REAL schema and the data that is actually
there, inside a transaction it rolls back — which is why `_delete_rows` is
factored out of `execute` without a commit.

`test_every_table_has_a_verdict` is the other half, and it is the one that will
fail for someone who has never read this file: add a table, and the purge stops
until you have said in `VERDICTS` whether it holds people or catalogue. That is
deliberate. The alternative — a prefix rule, or a default — is how a purge
either leaves a student's records behind or destroys the badge catalogue.
