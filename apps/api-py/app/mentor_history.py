"""The one place `students.mentor_id` moving is written down — B9.1.

FIVE WRITERS SET THAT POINTER, AND `mentor_functions.py` NAMES THEM BY COUNT AS
A KNOWN HAZARD: `routers/admin_mentoring.py` (the assignment screen), two paths in
`routers/admin_students.py` (the single PATCH and the batch action),
`app/seed.py` and `app/grant_access.py`. A sixth arrives one day. Every one of
them calls `record_mentor_change` and nothing writes `mentor_assignments`
directly, so the history cannot be half-kept: the failure mode of the
alternative is not a crash, it is a student whose mentor changed with no row to
say so, discovered months later by somebody asking who moved them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT A MOVE DOES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At most two rows are touched, and always in this order:

  1. The OPEN row for this student (`to_at IS NULL`), if there is one, is
     closed: `to_at`, `end_kind`, `ended_by_user_id`, `end_reason`.
  2. A new open row is created for the incoming mentor, if there is one.

A release closes and opens nothing. An assignment onto a student who had nobody
opens and closes nothing. A reassignment does both and stamps `reassign` on each
end, which is what makes "moved from Dr Rao to Dr Iyer on the 3rd, by the office,
because Dr Rao is on sabbatical" one act read from two rows rather than two
unrelated events.

Setting the same mentor again writes NOTHING. The console's per-student loop
sends one request per selected student and a re-save of an unchanged row is
routine; a history that grows a row every time somebody presses Save is a
history nobody reads.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE 90-DAY HANDOVER IS A SCOPED CAPABILITY GRANT, NOT A BRANCH IN RULE 2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

04 says "the previous mentor keeps read access until `to_at + 90 d`
(`policies.assert_student_scope` honours it)". Implemented literally that is a
third pass-branch in the function that gates THIRTY-SIX call sites, FIFTEEN OF
WHICH ARE WRITES — mentor notes, badge-evidence approval that mints an EARNED
badge, capability assessments, notebook entries. `assert_student_scope` cannot
express "read only": a branch that returns the student returns it to a POST as
readily as to a GET, so a 90-day READ becomes a 90-day right to write about a
student who is now somebody else's.

So the window is a `capability_grants` row instead: `mentor.mentees`, subject
the departing faculty account, `scope_level=STUDENT` pinned to that one student,
`expires_at = now + 90 days`, `reason="handover"`. Everything that makes this
safe already exists and is used by every other grant — `_live_grant_clauses`
filters revocation, expiry and approval IN SQL, the Governance screen lists it,
revoking it closes the door the same hour, and `record_change` files the act.

AND IT FIXES A HAZARD THE BRANCH ALONE COULD NOT. `mentor_functions_for` derives
the four `mentor.*` capabilities live from `mentee_count > 0`, so a faculty
member whose last mentee was just reassigned holds NONE of them:
`require_capability` refuses at the door with 403 and `assert_student_scope`
never runs at all. A handover honoured only inside rule 2 would be invisible to
precisely the person it was built for. A grant is unioned into
`capabilities_for`, so the mentee log opens again — for that one student, until
the date.

ONE read-only branch in `assert_student_scope` is still needed, because the
grant answers "which screen" and rule 2 asks "which student". It is
`allow_handover=False` by default and passed True at GET call sites only; see
`app/policies.py`.

`mentor.mentees` DOES NOT CARRY PII IN THE CATALOGUE, so this grant is written
`active` and works immediately. Were it ever marked `carries_pii`, B2.4 would
write it `pending_approval` and every handover on a one-admin deployment would
silently hold nothing — `tests/test_mentor_assignments.py` pins the activation
rather than the flag, so that change fails there and not in a support call.

NO GRANT IS MINTED FOR `faculty_disabled`. A disabled account cannot make a
request at all, so the grant would reach nothing; what it would do is put a live
handover row on the Governance screen for somebody who has been offboarded,
which reads as access nobody revoked.
