"""A link that works once and then stops — activation and password reset.

ONE TABLE, TWO JOBS (and a third is a row, not a migration). Setting a first
password and resetting a forgotten one are the same mechanism: a secret in an
email, a hash of it here, consumed exactly once. `purpose` is a plain String
so a future "confirm new email address" is `purpose="email_change"` and no
`CREATE TYPE`. Registration's own confirmation link is NOT here — it predates
this table and hangs off `registrations`, which is not a user yet; see
`EmailVerification` in registration.py.

THREE RULES THAT MAKE IT SAFE, from the agreed plan (docs/prototypes/.../passwords.html):

  1. THE LINK IS STORED HASHED, NEVER IN PLAIN TEXT. Same reason passwords are:
     a leaked dump of this table yields hashes, not a working link into every
     account with a pending reset. SHA-256, not scrypt — the token is 256
     random bits, not a guessable phrase, so a slow KDF buys nothing and only
     slows every click.
  2. USED ONCE, AND THE CHECK IS ATOMIC. `UPDATE ... WHERE consumed_at IS NULL`
     and act on the row count — the same trick interview finalisation uses for
     `status = 'running'`. Two clicks race; exactly one wins.
  3. SHORT LIVES. Activation 7 days (a new staff member may not check mail
     today). Reset 1 hour (the account exists and may already be under attack).

`consumed_at` is kept rather than the row deleted, so a second click can be
told apart from an expired link and given the right words.

THE SIGN-IN CODE BENDS TWO OF THESE, ON PURPOSE. `token_hash` is globally
unique (`uq_auth_token_hash`) — right for a 256-bit link, and a 500 waiting
to happen for a six-digit code, where two people dealt 482913 in the same
minute, or anyone re-drawing a code consumed last year, would collide on a
bare `sha256(code)`. So a code's hash is `sha256("login_code:<row id>:<code>")`
(account_links._hash_code): unique by construction, and findable ONLY by
(user, purpose), which is the scoping a shared code needs anyway. And a code's
dead rows are DELETED — its predecessors on re-issue, the last one by
`account_links.sweep_login_codes` — because /login/code answers one sentence
for every refusal, so there are no "already used" words to preserve, and one
permanent row per staff sign-in is a leak.

# The three secrets a newly approved student spends, in order. They are three
# purposes and not one because each proves a DIFFERENT thing, and collapsing
# them would let one proof stand in for another:
#
#   PURPOSE_ONBOARD       the link in the approval email. Proves only that the
#                         person opened mail sent to the address on the
#                         application. Long-lived (activation_link_hours).
#   PURPOSE_ONBOARD_CODE  the six-digit code, sent after they type their
#                         address back. Proves they can read that mailbox NOW,
#                         which the link alone does not — a forwarded link is
#                         still a valid link.
#   PURPOSE_ONBOARD_SET   a short-lived ticket minted only once the code is
#                         spent, and the only thing `onboard/password` accepts.
#                         Without it the password step would have to re-accept
#                         the code (already consumed) or trust the link alone,
#                         which would skip the mailbox proof entirely.

#: Purposes whose secret is SIX DIGITS, not a 256-bit link. Everything the

#: `sweep_login_codes` both branch on this set rather than on one name. A code
#: purpose left out of it would be minted with a bare sha256 and could collide
#: on `uq_auth_token_hash` with somebody else's identical six digits: a 500 in
#: the face of a person who typed the right code.
