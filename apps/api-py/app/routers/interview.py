"""Realtime AI mock interviewer — the student-facing assistant (Assistant V2).

  GET /api/interview/status   -> is an interview usable right now? (STUDENT)
  WS  /api/interview          -> one interview, relayed (STUDENT)

The engines themselves are app/interview_nova.py (Amazon Nova 2 Sonic, the
default) and app/interview_local.py (nothing leaves the machine); the contracts
they share are app/interview_core.py. This module is the boundary:
authentication, the STUDENT check, the concurrency cap, the server-owned
conversation, and the turn writer. It replaces POST /api/agent/ask as the
assistant screen's entry point — see the header on app/routers/agent.py, which
stays mounted and working as the rollback path.

AUTH IS REEP'S. The socket authenticates with the same httpOnly `reep_session`
cookie and the same verify_session_token as every HTTP route; no second token
scheme exists here. A browser WebSocket cannot set headers, but it DOES send
cookies on a SAME-ORIGIN handshake, and /api is same-origin by construction —
apps/web/proxy.conf.json forwards /api to this process with `"ws": true` in dev,
and there is one origin in production. The cookie is SameSite=Lax
(app/routers/auth.py), which is also why a cross-site page cannot carry it onto
this handshake at all.

RULE 1 (AGENTS.md). The hosted engine speaks to a REMOTE provider, so no
student record enters it. This module reads the session ONLY to answer "who owns
the conversation these turns are written to" — that id never leaves the process.
The sole thing sent upstream is the fixed persona in app/interview_core.py, the
fixed directives app/interview_matrix.py composes, and the student's microphone. Nothing here imports app.assistant_tools, app.knowledge or
app.ai.llm, and no student field is ever placed on the uplink.

PERSISTENCE, IN TWO PLACES THAT MUST NOT DISAGREE. Every turn still lands in the
SAME conversations/messages tables the text agent uses, through
app/conversations.py, so GET /api/agent/history returns them
unchanged and the AGENTS.md runbook query
    select channel, count(*), max(created_at) from messages group by channel;
grows an `interview` row. That contract does not bend.

ALONGSIDE it -- never instead of it -- each turn also writes an `interview_turns`
row carrying what a shared `messages` row cannot: the phase it happened in,
whether the transcriber actually heard it, and whether it advanced the arc. The
two inserts share ONE transaction (interview-engine-v3 §6.5). A second
fire-and-forget writer was considered and rejected: it doubles the pool pressure
at interview_max_sessions, and it can PARTIALLY succeed -- `messages` has the
turn and `interview_turns` does not, or the reverse -- which puts the runbook
query in the position of reporting "saved fine" while the reviewable record is
missing turns. That is the exact silent failure the runbook exists to catch,
reintroduced somewhere new.

An `interview_sessions` row is opened beside the conversation and closed by
whichever of three layers gets there first: the engine's own finalizer (Layer 1),
this module's `finally` backstop (Layer 2), and retention's orphan sweeper
(Layer 3, for the process that was killed). A `running` row that is never closed
is worse than no row -- it is a record that lies.

CONSENT IS ENFORCED HERE, and it is the last gate the socket passes. No live
`interview_consents` row for the CURRENT version -> the interview never opens and
the socket closes 4013; the grant revoked while the interview is running -> the
heartbeat notices within a minute and the socket closes 4014. Both gates read a
row, never a client claim, and the exact grant is pinned on
`interview_sessions.consent_id` so "was this student consented, to what wording,
at the time of interview X" survives every later revocation. The gate could only
be turned on AFTER the browser started posting grants (interview-engine-v3 §8.3),
which is why it arrived a step later than the table it reads.

AUDIO IS OFF, AND "OFF" IS TWO INDEPENDENT SWITCHES. This module is where the
recorder is constructed (app.interview_audio.recorder_for), and it hands back
None unless INTERVIEW_RECORDING_ENABLED is true AND the student holds a live
`scope_store_audio` grant. Neither is true in a default deployment, so nothing is
written. When both are true, the five `audio_*` columns written by the Layer 1
finalizer are the interview record's ONLY account of what was kept -- retention
deletes recordings by reading them -- which is why they are set in the same
UPDATE as the terminal status and not in a second write that could fail on its
own.

AND ONE ROW PER WAV IN `archived_documents`, WHICH ANSWERS A DIFFERENT QUESTION.
Those five columns say what THIS interview kept, and they are deleted with the
interview after INTERVIEW_RETENTION_DAYS (and outright by
`python -m app.purge_people`). The nightly sweep has by then copied the files
into the Object-Locked archive under their own names and nothing else, so the
moment the row goes the bucket holds a named student's recorded voice that
nobody can name. The Layer 1 finalizer writes the manifest row that answers it
-- see `_record_audio_in_the_manifest`. It is an INDEX and never a second set of
audio columns: retention still sweeps the store by session id and never by what
a row believes.

    """A SYNCHRONOUS writer for one interview's turns, bound to BOTH its records.

    `store_transcript=False` IS THE COLLEGE SAYING DO NOT KEEP THE WORDS (B6.1),
    and it is the FIRST enforcement of that scope — the boolean has been
    recorded on every consent row since 2026-08 and read by nothing, so the copy
    on the assistant screen promised something no code decided. It suppresses
    BOTH rows, not one: keeping `interview_turns` and dropping `messages` would
    leave the student's own words in the reviewable record while the chat
    history claimed they were gone, which is the more dishonest half of the two.
    The REPORT is still written — a scorecard is what the student and their
    mentor read, and it quotes nobody.

    Suppression is a decision taken ONCE, at open, and passed in: re-reading the
    policy per turn would let an edit that lands mid-interview keep half of one
    transcript. `interview_sessions.transcript_suppressed` records that the same
    decision was taken, because `turns_emitted` > `turns_persisted` is
    AGENTS.md's runbook signal for dropped writes and this would otherwise fire
    it on every interview at such a college.

    The keyword defaults to True so that every existing caller — the platform
    media bridge and the engine tests — keeps exactly the behaviour it had.

    Synchronous on purpose: app/conversations.py is synchronous SQLAlchemy, and
    the relay runs this on a worker thread (asyncio.to_thread) so a round trip to
    Postgres never stalls the event loop carrying every other student's audio.

    It takes its OWN short-lived connection and Session per turn rather than
    holding one for the call. An interview runs up to 15 minutes; a Session held
    that long pins a pooled connection and keeps an idle transaction open, which
    blocks autovacuum and — at interview_max_sessions — would starve every HTTP
    request on this worker. This is also why the WebSocket route has no
    Depends(get_db).

    It deliberately does NOT catch the general case. The engine calls this
    fire-and-forget and logs a failure with its cause against the connection id
    (each engine's own `_run_turn_write`), so catching here would only lose the
    one identifier that makes the line diagnosable. The two exceptions below are
    handled because neither is that: one is not a failure at all, and the other
    is a failure only the engine can act on.

    TWO INSERTS, ONE TRANSACTION (§6.5), AND THAT COSTS ONE UNUSUAL LINE. The
    Session is bound to a Connection that already has a transaction open, with
    `join_transaction_mode="create_savepoint"`, because `append_message` ends
    with its own `db.commit()` — and inside a joined transaction that commit
    releases a SAVEPOINT instead of ending the real one. So both rows land in a
    single COMMIT to Postgres, and `interview_turns.message_id` can be filled in
    from a Message that has an id only after that flush.

    Two traps in that arrangement, both silent if got wrong:

      * `db.close()` ROLLS BACK the open savepoint. The explicit `db.commit()`
        before the `finally` is what releases it; without that line the FK
        back-link is written and then quietly discarded, and the only symptom is
        a `message_id` column that is always NULL.
      * an IntegrityError on EITHER table rolls back BOTH. That is deliberate,
        not a cost we failed to avoid: `interview_turns` carries the same
        `(session, provider_turn_id)` unique shape as `messages`, so a retry of
        one turn is a no-op either way — the turn is already stored by the
        winner. The alternative, two independent writers, can leave the two
        records disagreeing about which turns happened, and a record that can
        silently disagree with `messages` has no value at all.

    """One `archived_documents` row per WAV this interview left on disk.

    WHY THE ROW HAS TO EXIST AT ALL. `python -m app.archive_documents` copies
    every recording into `reep-documents-archive-<account>` -- versioned,
    Object-Locked, no lifecycle rule -- under the file's own name and nothing
    else. The only thing that has ever known whose voice that is is the
    `interview_sessions` row pointing at it, and that row is deleted after
    INTERVIEW_RETENTION_DAYS and emptied outright by `python -m
    app.purge_people`. So without this, a pass whose whole purpose is removing
    every trace of a person leaves their recorded voice in a bucket that cannot
    delete it, indexed by nothing -- which is precisely the failure
    `archived_documents` was built to prevent, arriving through the one store
    that does not go through `document_manifest.save_and_record`.
    `DocumentOwnerKind.INTERVIEW_AUDIO` has been in the manifest since its first
    migration with no writer behind it; this is the writer.

    WHY IT IS WRITTEN HERE. Three places could have: the recorder, the sweep,
    and this finalizer. The recorder runs on the audio hot path, holds no
    Session and does not know which student it is recording. The sweep "needs no
    database and deliberately does not open one" -- read its docstring, the
    argument is that the filesystem is the authority and a sweep driven by rows
    silently skips every file whose row never landed -- and making it open one
    would trade that property for this bookkeeping. This function is the only
    point that holds all three facts at once: a Session, a set of files the
    relay has already closed and flushed, and the record saying whose interview
    it was.

    THE ROW ITSELF IS WRITTEN BY `document_manifest.record_existing`, NOT HERE.
    None of that module's original three entry points could express "record a
    file that already exists" -- `save_and_record` WRITES BYTES through
    `document_store.save_bytes`, which accepts PDF/PNG/JPEG by magic number and
    holds the whole file in memory under a 10 MB ceiling, and a WAV of tens of
    megabytes written incrementally over eight minutes in a different store is
    none of that; `release` stamps `released_at`, which would tell every future
    reader the recording was gone on the day it was made; `reattribute` only
    edits a row that is already there. So a fourth verb was added beside them
    rather than this file constructing the model itself. §36 of
    tests/test_codebase_guards.py pins ONE writer of `archived_documents` by
    scanning every module for the constructor outside the manifest, and it was
    right to: the manifest is the only thing that can ever say whose file an
    object in a bucket with no delete permission was, and a second writer is
    how one of them quietly stops setting `owner_id`. This function's job is to
    work out the FACTS -- which files exist, whose interview it was, how big
    each one is -- and hand them over.

    IT CANNOT FAIL THE INTERVIEW CLOSE. Everything is inside one `except`, the
    way every other write on this path is: the student's close frame has
    already gone out, the terminal status has already committed, and an index
    that could take the record down with it would be worth less than no index.

    """Stamp heartbeat_at — and notice a consent grant that has gone away (4014).

    Scoped to `status = 'running'` so a heartbeat still in flight when the
    session finalizes cannot touch a row that is already closed — the sweeper
    keys on status anyway, but a closed row with a moving timestamp is the kind
    of thing that costs somebody an afternoon.

    THE SECOND STATEMENT IS 4014, AND IT IS A POLL, NOT THE PUSH §7.1 SKETCHES.
    Having `DELETE /api/interview/consent` call a `stop_sessions_for_user()`
    would be immediate, and it would also be wrong most of the time: any
    registry it could consult — `_LIVE_SESSIONS` here included — is per-PROCESS,
    so with N uvicorn workers the revoking request lands on a worker that is not
    holding the socket in (N-1)/N of cases, and the push then does nothing at
    all while looking like it worked. Re-reading the grant on a heartbeat the
    session is already issuing catches a revocation from any worker, any tab and
    any future code path that stamps `revoked_at`, for one indexed SELECT a
    minute per live interview. The cost is up to _HEARTBEAT_WRITE_INTERVAL_S of
    delay, and that is a backstop's delay rather than a student watching a
    button: the assistant screen refuses to offer "Withdraw" while an interview
    is running (assistant.component.ts).

    IT WATCHES THE EXACT GRANT THE INTERVIEW OPENED UNDER, by id, never "is
    there a live grant for the current version". An operator bumping
    INTERVIEW_CONSENT_VERSION mid-session would otherwise end every interview in
    progress with "you withdrew consent", which is a sentence the student did
    not earn and an event nobody could explain afterwards.

    IT FAILS OPEN, and that asymmetry against the gate in `_open_records` is
    deliberate. Opening an interview fails CLOSED because "we could not check
    whether they agreed" must never start one. Ending an interview must not:
    a transient database error here would kill a live call that a real grant
    authorised, so the stop runs only on a query that came back and said the row
    is gone. Anything that raises propagates to the relay's own "heartbeat not
    written" warning, and the interview continues.

    Both new arguments are keyword-only and default to None, which means "stamp
    the heartbeat and watch nothing". That is the shape the relay's own tests
    want, and it is honest for them: they have no consent row to watch. It is
    never the shape a real interview gets — `_open_records` refuses without a
    grant, so a live session always has an id to pass here.

    B6.1 ADDED A THIRD ARGUMENT AND IT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN "SUPERSEDED"
    AND "WITHDRAWN". The student now posts an ACKNOWLEDGEMENT of the college's
    policy at every Start, and `POST /api/interview/consent` supersedes the live
    grant when its scopes differ — which stamps `revoked_at` on exactly the row
    a running interview is pinned to. Watching only "is the pinned row revoked"
    would then let a second tab's Start end the interview in the first with
    "Consent withdrawn", a sentence the student did not earn.

    So when the pinned grant is gone, this asks a second question: does this
    user still hold a LIVE grant covering every scope this interview is running
    under? If they do, the acknowledgement was replaced by an equal-or-wider one
    and the call continues. If they do not, a scope this interview depends on is
    gone and the session ends 4014 — which is the compatibility board's rule
    ("a policy change stops a running session with 4014 only when it removes a
    scope") expressed as a property of the grant rather than as a second read of
    the policy table on every heartbeat of every live interview.

    Passing no `consent_scopes` keeps the OLD behaviour exactly — any revocation
    of the pinned row stops the session — which is what the platform media
    bridge and the existing tests ask for.

    THE SECOND QUERY RUNS ONLY WHEN THE FIRST SAID THE ROW IS GONE, so the steady
    state is still one indexed SELECT a minute, and the fail-OPEN property is
    unchanged: anything that raises propagates to the relay's "heartbeat not
    written" warning and the interview continues.

    """The conversation AND the interview_sessions row, in one session, one hop.

    Opened together because a turn write needs both ids and because
    `interview_turns.interview_session_id` is NOT NULL — the session row must
    exist BEFORE the first turn, which is one extra insert per interview and not
    one per turn. A failure of either fails the socket the same way (1011), which
    is the honest answer: an interview whose record cannot be opened would be an
    interview nobody can review afterwards.

    THE CONSENT GATE IS NOW ENFORCED, and it is the FIRST statement — §8.3's
    ordering constraint is satisfied: `apps/web` posts to
    POST /api/interview/consent before it starts an interview and maps 4013 and
    4014, so turning this on no longer locks every existing student out of the
    feature on the deploy that ships it. It reads and it refuses; there is no
    "record whatever happened to be live" path left, because a grant that is not
    required is not a grant.

    IT REFUSES BEFORE IT WRITES. Nothing is created on this path — no
    conversation, no `interview_sessions` row — so a student who has not agreed
    leaves behind no record of an interview that never happened, and the orphan
    sweeper never meets a `running` row that had no socket.

    IT FAILS CLOSED by construction: an unreachable database raises out of this
    function and the socket closes 1011, which refuses the interview. "We could
    not check whether they agreed" and "they agreed" are not the same sentence,
    and only one of them may put a student's voice on a remote provider's wire.

    `consent_id` still pins the exact grant, and that remains the whole point of
    the column: "was this student consented, to what wording, at the time of
    interview X" stays answerable years later, after the grant has been revoked
    and re-given twice.
