"""REEP's core AWS footprint as one CDK stack — the successor to infra/aws/.

WHY THIS FILE IS SHAPED THE WAY IT IS. Every resource here already EXISTS,
created by Terraform and holding real student data. This stack is not a fresh
build; it is a description of what is running, precise enough that
`cdk import` can adopt each resource into CloudFormation without touching it.
That single fact decides three things:

  1. PHYSICAL NAMES ARE THE TERRAFORM NAMES, LITERALLY. `reep-api-task`,
     `/reep/api`, `reep-postgres`, `reep-vault`. An import matches on the
     identifier and then compares properties; a different name is a different
     resource, and for an immutable property (a security group's name, a task
     family) the next deploy would REPLACE it — which for the database is an
     outage and for a security group is every task losing its network. The
     names are asserted against the .tf files by the synth tests.

  2. L1 (`Cfn*`) WHEREVER L2 WOULD INVENT STRUCTURE. `ec2.Vpc` lays out its own
     subnets and route tables; `iam.OpenIdConnectProvider` is a Lambda-backed
     custom resource; `rds.DatabaseInstance` mints a new master password.
     None of those can be imported over what exists. L2 is used only where it
     maps 1:1 onto one CloudFormation resource with the properties we need.

  3. TWO PHASES, ONE CONTEXT KEY. `-c phase=import` renders the mirror of what
     exists and NOTHING else — `cdk import` refuses a template that also adds
     resources it cannot import. `-c phase=harden` (the default) is the same
     stack plus every fix this migration exists to make. The synth tests pin
     that the import phase is a strict subset.

WHAT `harden` ADDS, and why each is here rather than in Terraform:

  * The container's `stopTimeout` is 120 s — FARGATE'S HARD MAXIMUM, not the
    500 s the first plan assumed. A 480 s interview is therefore protected by
    the target group's DEREGISTRATION DELAY (600 s): the ALB stops routing
    new connections to a draining task but keeps its open WebSockets until
    they close, and ECS waits for draining before it sends SIGTERM. Then
    uvicorn's `--timeout-graceful-shutdown 110` (Dockerfile) fits inside the
    120. The api's own number is pinned against this file by
    tests/test_codebase_guards.py, so the two cannot drift apart silently.
  * The backup vault is LOCKED (governance mode: a minimum retention nobody
    can shorten by accident), every recovery point is COPIED to a vault in
    ap-southeast-1, and a weekly RESTORE TEST proves the copies are usable —
    a backup that has never been restored is a hope, not a backup.
  * RDS automated retention and the AWS Backup rule read ONE number
    (`backupRetentionDays`). They were 14 and 35 — two answers to "how far
    back can we go", and the honest one was the shorter.
  * An ARCHIVE TIER above it (`archiveRetentionDays`, off unless set): a
    second plan, monthly, with an RDS-ONLY selection and a lifecycle measured
    in years. 35 days is RDS's ceiling on its own automated backups, not AWS
    Backup's — so without this every copy of the database in both regions
    expired on day 36 and a loss discovered five weeks later was unrecoverable
    everywhere at once. It is a second PLAN because a selection is plan-scoped:
    on the daily plan the same rule would keep every student's uploaded
    document for years as well. See the constant for what that costs.
  * Multi-AZ on by default (`-c dbMultiAz=false` to opt out — it doubles the
    instance cost, and that is a decision, so it is written down here).
  * The task role may send mail through SES for the college's verified
    identity (activation and reset links, app/mail_transport.py).
  * BLUE/GREEN, behind `-c blueGreen=true` (default OFF, and only with the ECS
    half): a second long-lived service `api-green` on target group
    `reep-api-green`, two colour-pinned task families (`reep-api-blue` on
    `:blue`, `reep-api-green` on `:green`), and a priority-10 listener RULE
    whose weighted forward says which colour takes new connections. The
    deploy workflow rolls the IDLE colour, proves it through header-routed
    probe rules, then rewrites the rule's two weights; rollback is the same
    call the other way, in seconds, onto tasks that are already warm. No
    CodeDeploy and no deployment controller — switching an existing
    service's controller is a REPLACE of the live service. The existing
    `api` / `reep-api` pair is kept, name for name, as the blue colour.
    docs/blue-green-cutover.md.
  * A `MasterUserPassword` NEVER appears in this template. The instance keeps
    the password Terraform generated, held inside the app secret's
    DATABASE_URL. Writing one here would rotate it under the running api. A
    synth test refuses the template if the property ever shows up.

Two Terraform resources have no counterpart and are dropped on purpose:
`random_password.db` and `random_password.auth_secret` — their VALUES live in
the secrets already; the generators are not infrastructure. The two
`aws_secretsmanager_secret_version`s are likewise not modelled: this stack
imports the secrets by ARN and never writes a version. Secret values are the
operator's, and a CloudFormation deploy must not be able to overwrite them.

DEFAULT_BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS = 35

#: THE ARCHIVE TIER, AND WHY IT IS A SECOND NUMBER RATHER THAN A BIGGER ONE.
#: `backupRetentionDays` is capped at 35 below because RDS refuses more on its
#: automated backups — so every copy of the database, in both regions, expired
#: on day 36 and a record deleted, corrupted or mis-migrated five weeks ago was
#: gone everywhere at once. AWS Backup has no such ceiling: a second rule with
#: its own lifecycle is the whole fix, and it is the only one that reaches the
#: WHOLE database rather than a chosen subset of columns.
#:
#: ZERO IS OFF, and that is the code default rather than a year, so a synth
#: with no context renders the stack that exists today. cdk.json turns it on,
#: the way `blueGreen` is turned on: the number is a decision, so it is written
#: down where a decision is read.
#:
#: WHAT IT COSTS BESIDES MONEY, said here because nothing else will say it: a
#: student erased by `python -m app.purge_students` stays restorable, and fully
#: identified, for as long as this number runs — in a vault whose governance
#: lock neither destructor can reach. That is a records-retention decision for
#: the college, not a default, which is the other reason it is a separate key.
DEFAULT_ARCHIVE_RETENTION_DAYS = 0

#: AWS Backup's own ceiling on a lifecycle (100 years).
MAX_ARCHIVE_RETENTION_DAYS = 36500

#: How long the DAILY logical dump is locked, and therefore kept.
#:
#: The physical snapshots already answer "restore last Tuesday" for 35 days.
#: This tier exists to answer it from an artefact that does not need RDS at
#: all, so a number at or below the snapshots' would add nothing they do not
#: already give; 90 is the span across which a loss is usually noticed.
DEFAULT_DUMP_DAILY_DAYS = 90

#: The gap between the daily object's Object Lock expiry and the lifecycle
#: rule that deletes it.
#:
#: NOT padding, and not a rounding allowance. A lifecycle expiration aimed at
#: an object whose retention has not lapsed is NOT AN ERROR -- S3 re-evaluates
#: it the next day, and the next, deleting nothing and reporting nothing, so
#: the bucket grows without bound behind a rule the console shows as working.
#: Setting the two to the same number makes that race a coin toss on every
#: object. Seven days makes it impossible.
DUMP_LIFECYCLE_LAG_DAYS = 7

#: The monthly archive copy's Object Lock retention, in years.
#:
#: THIS IS A PLACEHOLDER FOR A DECISION THE COLLEGE HAS NOT MADE. The real
#: question is "how long must a graduate's academic record remain retrievable",
#: which is a records-retention policy and not an engineering choice —
#: `archiveRetentionDays` carries the same caveat for the same reason. Ten
#: years is long enough to be useful and short enough not to be a promise
#: nobody agreed to. It costs a few dollars a year at this data volume.
DEFAULT_DUMP_ARCHIVE_YEARS = 10

#: How long an uploaded DOCUMENT is locked in the permanent archive, in years.
#:
#: THE SAME PLACEHOLDER CAVEAT `DEFAULT_DUMP_ARCHIVE_YEARS` CARRIES, and the
#: same unanswered question: "how long must a graduate's academic record remain
#: retrievable" is a records-retention policy and not an engineering choice.
#: The difference is what the number governs. That one bounds a `pg_dump` --
#: rows, re-derivable in principle from a later dump. This one bounds the only
#: copy of a scanned marksheet a student has since deleted, which nothing
#: regenerates. It is deliberately the same ten so the two tiers expire
#: together: a deployment holding the rows that describe a certificate for a
#: decade and the certificate itself for one year has a record that decays into
#: a set of dangling pointers.

            # failure: a student who never asked for a reset was never failed.
