"""Compile the per-degree catalogue into the engine's own contract and run the
existing Nova 2 Sonic session with it.

The architecture's AI Interview Engine is Nova Sonic 2, and REEP already has
one: `app.interview_nova.NovaSonicSession`, with the persona, the phase
machine, the deterministic answer gate, the two-beat close and the scorecard
tool call all pinned by tests. This module does not copy any of it. It builds
an `interview_matrix.Specialization` from the platform's rows — persona,
frameworks, syllabus, voice and the question bank — and passes the degree
level's time limit as the session cap. Everything downstream (the router's
writers, the recorder hook, the three close layers, the Angular client) is the
same code path as `/api/interview`.

Rule 1 holds: the compiled instructions are staff-authored catalogue text. No
candidate record is read here and no student field is composed into them.
