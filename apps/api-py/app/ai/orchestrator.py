# NOTE (2026-08): the student-facing assistant is now the realtime mock
# interviewer in app/routers/interview.py; this orchestrator no longer backs

# client. See docs/interview-assistant.md. Delete nothing here.

"""The REEP assistant's TOOL-BACKED ORCHESTRATOR.

The model is a *language + orchestration* layer, never the source of truth.
Every specific fact about a student comes from a read-only tool in
``app.assistant_tools`` (which runs the same code path as the student's own
screens); every policy statement comes from an APPROVED knowledge chunk. The
model only ever *phrases* what the tools return — and student PII is never sent
to a refused (off-machine) provider.

``answer_question`` is the one entry point. It:

1. Classifies the question with rule-based intent routing — no PII leaves the
   process to classify (the router only reads the question text).
2. For STUDENT-DATA intents (readiness, gaps, jobs, skills, profile, deadlines)
   it composes the answer + actions DETERMINISTICALLY from the tool result. It
   may *optionally* polish the wording through a LOCAL/allowed model, but never
   sends the record to a provider the egress gate refuses.
3. For POLICY intents it retrieves approved chunks and grounds the answer over
   ONLY that public text (remote model OK — no student PII). No hit -> an honest
   "no approved answer", never a guess.
4. For GENERAL questions it falls back to the free-form assistant.

The return shape is an ``AssistantResponse`` dict::

    {
      "answer": str,
      "actions": [{"label": str, "route": str, "reason": str}],
      "sources": [{"label": str, "type": str}],   # type: student-record | policy
      "limitations": [str],
      "intent": str,      # the intent classify() routed on (grounding signal)
      "resolved": bool,   # True iff grounded in a student tool OR an approved
