"""The tool-backed orchestrator + POST /api/agent/ask.

The contract these tests pin:

  * STUDENT-DATA intents are composed DETERMINISTICALLY from the read-only tools
    and cite a 'student-record' source — the model is never the source of truth,
    and (with a remote provider) the student's PII is never sent to classify or
    to answer.
  * POLICY intents are grounded over ONLY approved knowledge chunks and cite a
    'policy' source; an unanswerable policy question yields the honest
    "no approved answer" fallback, never a guess.
  * Intent routing lands each question on the right tool.

The intent-routing tests are pure (no DB). The end-to-end tests hit the seeded
dev DB through the TestClient and are skipped when Postgres is unreachable. Where
a model call would otherwise be non-deterministic, `complete_chat` is
monkeypatched so the assertion pins behaviour, not a provider's wording.
