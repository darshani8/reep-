| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-600 |
| Module | Admin: analytics |
| Priority | P1 |
| Type | Functional, positive |
| Automated test | `tests/07-admin-operations.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-600` |

### Pre-conditions

1. The web app and the API are running with a development `ENV`, and the dev
   seed has been applied.
2. You are signed in as the Main Admin.
3. For the expected figures, open these API addresses in the same browser
   while signed in, and note what they answer:
   `/api/admin/analytics-summary` (`students_total`, `mentors_total`),
   `/api/admin/analytics/kpis?weeks=6` (the value of each tile),
   `/api/admin/mentor-load` (each faculty account's name, `mentee_count` and
   `capacity`) and `/api/mentor/alerts?open_only=true` (each open alert's
   `message` and `student_name`).

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Account | Main Admin, `admin@bgscet.ac.in` |
| Seeded faculty account | Test Mentor, capacity 20, one student (Test Student) |

### Steps

1. Open `/admin/analytics`.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 1 | The page heading is "Charts & numbers", and the line under it starts "Programme-wide · N student · M mentor with a group", with N and M the `students_total` and `mentors_total` from the API (a count other than one takes the plural: "students", "mentors"). |
| ER-2 | 1 | The key-figure tiles are shown in this order: Placement rate, Median CTC, Highest CTC, Placement ready %, Attendance average, Mock interviews, Pending approvals. Each measured tile shows the API's value (a percentage with "%", a count as a whole number), and each tile the API left unmeasured shows "—" with the API's reason under it. |
| ER-3 | 1 | The "Mentor load" card is headed "Mentor load · N faculty account", N being the number of accounts `/api/admin/mentor-load` lists ("accounts" when N is not one). Its table shows them 8 to a page, in the API's order, by name and with their mentees as "count / capacity": on the seed, the one row reads "Test Mentor" and "1 / 20". |
| ER-4 | 1 | The "Alerts · open" card lists every open alert with its message and the student's name, for example "Attendance in Managerial Economics dropped below 80%." for Test Student. When the API lists no open alert, the card says "Nothing open." instead. |

| Module | Admin: jobs sheet |
| Priority | P2 |
| Type | Functional, positive |
| Automated test | `tests/07-admin-operations.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-625` |

### Pre-conditions

1. Signed in as the Main Admin, and a posting with the test data, with no
   applications, is on the sheet. The automated run creates it through the
   API.

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Title | `E2E Remove <test run id>` |

| Module | Admin: jobs sheet |
| Priority | P3 |
| Type | Functional, positive |
| Automated test | `tests/07-admin-operations.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-626` |

### Pre-conditions

1. As TC-620: the seeded posting "Financial Analyst" at Acme Capital,
   Bengaluru, is on the sheet.

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Searches | `Acme Capital`, then `Bengaluru` |

### Steps

1. Open `/admin/jobs`.
2. Type "Acme Capital" in "Search postings…".
3. Replace the search with "Bengaluru".

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 2 | The Financial Analyst row is listed: the search box is labelled "Search postings by role, company or location", and Acme Capital is its company. |
| ER-2 | 3 | The Financial Analyst row is listed: Bengaluru is its location. |

### Known issue

Fails today: the search matches the posting's title only, and answers "Rows: 0"
for a company or a location. The grid's Posting column is keyed on the title
(`field: 'title'` in `apps/web/src/app/features/admin/jobs-sheet/jobs-grid.ts`)
and draws the company and location with a cell renderer, which the grid's
quick filter does not search. The automated test is marked as a known failure.

| Module | Admin: REEP Agent |

| Type | Functional, positive |
| Automated test | `tests/07-admin-operations.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-670` |

### Pre-conditions

1. Signed in as the Main Admin, and the Main Admin's agent conversation is
   empty (click "Clear conversation" first if it is not). The automated run
   clears it through the API.
2. The Knowledge Base has been seeded (`python -m app.seed_kb`), so the agent
   has approved policy text to answer from. With no model configured the
   agent answers from that text directly.

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Question | "How do I verify a skill?" (a suggested question) |

### Steps

1. Open `/admin/agent`.
2. Click the suggested question "How do I verify a skill?".
3. Click the Helpful button under the answer.
4. Click "Clear conversation".

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 1 | The heading is "REEP Agent". The side card "What the agent can see" reads "Signed in as" "Main Admin (seed) · Main Admin", and the empty conversation says "How can I help today?". |
| ER-2 | 2 | The question appears as your message, and the agent answers about raising a skill claim with proof, citing "Source: Verifying a skill (e.g. Power BI)". |
| ER-3 | 2 | **Manual only.** On a server with a language model configured, the answer is written by the model from the same approved sources instead of quoting them. |
| ER-4 | 3 | "Thanks for the feedback" is shown, and the Helpful button is marked pressed. |
| ER-5 | 4 | The conversation is empty again: "How can I help today?" is shown. |
