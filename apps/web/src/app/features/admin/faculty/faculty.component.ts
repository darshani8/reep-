 *
 * WHAT IS STILL NOT, AND WHY IT IS DRAWN RATHER THAN LEFT OUT. One control
 * stays disabled and one column stays an em dash: "Grant function" and Sign-in.
 * Each has its reason on the constant that carries it, and NEITHER reason is a
 * missing endpoint any more — see GRANT_FUNCTION_REASON and faculty-grid.ts's
 * SIGN_IN_PENDING_REASON. Nothing on this screen names a phase, because nothing
 * left on it is waiting for one.
 *
 * "Review expiring grants" WAS the third, on the grounds that B2.4's endpoint
 * existed but nothing drew its queue. Governance drew it, so the button is a
 * link now — `/admin/governance?tab=review`, which opens the queue rather than
 * landing the admin on that screen's front page to find the tab themselves. A plausible "Active · today 09:12"
 * in a screenshot is indistinguishable from working software; so is a button
 * that opens a screen nobody has built.
 *
 * THE ONE ACT ON THIS SCREEN THAT CANNOT BE UNDONE BY CLICKING AGAIN is
 * disabling an account, and it is the one that goes through a dialog rather
 * than a button: `disable-faculty-dialog.component.ts` states what happens,
 * takes the reason the server requires, and posts it itself.
 *
 * THE ONE-SCREEN ACTIVATION LINK IS NOT A STOPGAP. AGENTS.md is explicit: when
 * somebody says "the email never arrived" — and somebody will — the admin reads
 * them this link rather than waiting on a mail queue. So it is a first-class
 * control here, with its expiry and whether mail actually went, and the copy
 * says that each new link supersedes the previous one.
 *
 * THIS SCREEN IS MAIN-ADMIN-ONLY IN PRACTICE, AND ITS ROUTE GUARD IS NOT.
 * The route asks for `admin.mentors` (spec §7), but FOUR of the five endpoints
 * above are `require_admin` — the office account alone: `GET /admin/faculty`
 * and `PATCH /admin/faculty/{id}` (routers/admin_faculty.py) and
 * `POST /users/{id}/activation-link` (routers/admin.py). The other two ask for
 * different capabilities again: `/admin/departments` for `admin.institution`
 * and `/admin/mentor-load` for `admin.analytics`. So a faculty member granted
 * only `admin.mentors` in Governance passes the guard and is refused the LIST
 * — not just a column. `directoryRefused` is why that reads as a refusal and
 * never as an empty roster. Closing the gap is a decision for the owner: give
 * the directory its own capability, or hand the three out together.
 *
 * The row shapes and the grid's columns live beside this file, in
 * `faculty-row.ts` and `faculty-grid.ts`; the offboarding dialog is
 * `disable-faculty-dialog.component.ts`.
