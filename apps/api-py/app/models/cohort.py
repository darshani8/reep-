    # The department this batch belongs to, and through it the college — the two
    # levels the student's locked profile card needs and the schema had no way
    # to answer. NULLABLE because `cohorts` predates `departments`: existing
    # rows have no department to point at, and a NOT NULL here would make the
    # migration unrunnable on any database that already has cohorts. An admin
    # sets it; until then the card shows a dash rather than a guess.

    # ------------------------------------------------------------------ #
    # THE TWO OPTIONAL LEVELS, denormalised as ancestor pointers.
    #
    # WHY BOTH AND NOT JUST THE DEEPEST. A batch legitimately attaches at ANY
    # depth — department only, or course, or specialization — because the levels
    # are individually optional. One `specialization_id` cannot express
    # "attached at course level", and a polymorphic column cannot be a foreign
    # key. So both exist, beside `department_id`.
    #
    # WHY THAT IS NOT THREE SOURCES OF TRUTH. There is exactly ONE writer:
    # `_resolve_ancestry` in app/routers/admin.py. The client names only the
    # DEEPEST level it knows; the API walks UP the real foreign keys to fill in
    # the rest, and a shallower value the client also sent is CHECKED against
    # the derived one rather than stored beside it. A contradiction is a 422
    # naming both, never a silent pick — because the silent pick surfaces as a
    # profile card printing the wrong department under the words "verified by
    # Main Admin".
    #
    # WHY THIS IS NOT THE DENORMALISATION THE BUILD LOG FORBIDS. That rule is
    # about copying college/department onto `students` — thousands of rows,
    # where inserting a level becomes a backfill. Here `cohorts` numbers in the
    # dozens, and `department_id` staying always-set and always-correct is what
    # keeps every existing endpoint and its tests working untouched.
    #
    # NULLABLE PERMANENTLY. Requiredness lives in HIERARCHY_LEVELS
    # (app/models/institution.py), never in the schema. See that constant.
