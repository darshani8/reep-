"""Auth endpoints â password sign-in (dev/CI) and Google sign-in (everywhere).

  POST /api/auth/login                 -> email + password. REFUSED when ENV=prod.
  POST /api/auth/login/code            -> the emailed one-time code, when OTP_REQUIRED=true
  GET  /api/auth/sso/status            -> which sign-in doors this server offers
  GET  /api/auth/sso/google            -> begin Google sign-in (302 to Google)
  GET  /api/auth/sso/google/callback   -> finish it (302 back into the SPA)
  GET  /api/auth/me                    -> the current session
  POST /api/auth/logout                -> clear the cookie AND revoke the token
  POST /api/auth/sign-out-everywhere   -> retire every device, this one included

THE CALLBACK PATH IS A CONTRACT, not a preference. It is registered as an
"Authorised redirect URI" on the Google OAuth client, derived by
app/google_auth.py:redirect_uri() from google_auth.CALLBACK_PATH, and documented
in .env.example. Google compares the redirect_uri byte for byte between the
authorize request and the token exchange, so renaming this route without
changing all four places fails every sign-in with `redirect_uri_mismatch` and
nothing in this repo to point at. `/api/auth/sso/google` is also the href the
login screen carries (apps/web .../login/login.component.ts:signInUrl), and
`/api/auth/sso/status` is the capability probe it reads before rendering â both
canonical, neither an alias, because a login screen pointed at a hidden
back-compat path becomes collateral damage the day the alias is tidied away.

ONE SESSION, TWO DOORS. Both sign-in paths end in the same four steps:
retire the account's other sessions, `_record_login`, `_payload_for`,
`_issue_session`. The cookie is the same
httpOnly `reep_session`, signed the same way, carrying the same camelCase claims
(userId/email/name/role/studentId?/mentorId?) that the Next.js app minted and
that every consumer still reads â app/identity.py, require_mentor,
_assert_can_access_student, the WebSocket auth in app/routers/interview.py, and
the Angular `SessionPayload`. Google authenticates; it does not authorise, and it
does not get a session mechanism of its own. Nothing downstream can tell which
door a session came through, which is exactly the point.

THE ROSTER IS THE ALLOWLIST. A verified Google identity whose email matches no
`User` row is refused. There is no just-in-time provisioning: a provisioned
account would need a role invented for it, and AGENTS.md rule 2 makes guessing a
role a data-exposure bug rather than a UX one (a wrong MENTOR/ADMIN reads
every student's marks, attendance and USN). Accounts are created from the roster
by `python -m app.seed_roster`, which is also where the USN comes from â so a
student's profile shows it already filled in and they never type it.

THE EMAIL FINDS THE ROW; THE GOOGLE `sub` PINS IT. An institutional address is a
lease the college re-issues to the next intake, so matching on the address alone
meant a new holder of 1mp25mdm01@ signed in â verified, error-free â into the
previous student's marks, uploads and mentor notes. `users.google_sub` is set on
the first Google sign-in and compared on every one after; a mismatch is refused
(`sso_identity_mismatch`) and logged rather than reconciled, because only a
human can tell a legitimate re-issue from someone who arranged one.

ONE DEVICE AT A TIME. An account holds exactly one live session: every sign-in
advances `users.token_version`, which retires the tokens minted before it, so
signing in on a phone drops the laptop on its next request. The newest sign-in
wins, deliberately -- refusing the new device instead would lock out the student
whose browser crashed until a row expired. See _retire_other_sessions.

A SESSION CAN NOW BE REVOKED, within the limits app/security.py states plainly.
`users.token_version` rides in the token and logout bumps it, so signing out on
a shared lab machine finally invalidates a copy of the cookie rather than merely
forgetting it here. It is best-effort across workers, not a session store.

FAILURES REDIRECT, THEY DO NOT RETURN JSON. The callback is a top-level browser
navigation: a 4xx there is a raw FastAPI error page outside the SPA. Every
failure lands on `{WEB_ORIGIN}/login?error=<code>` instead, and the login screen
turns the code into a sentence. The codes are:

    sso_config            Google sign-in is not configured on this server
    sso_denied            the student cancelled at Google's consent screen
    sso_state             state/cookie missing or mismatched (see read_flow_state)
    sso_token             code exchange failed (config, network, spent code)
    sso_identity          the ID token did not verify
    sso_unverified_email  Google reports the address as unverified
    sso_not_enrolled      verified, but no roster row for that address
    sso_identity_mismatch the roster row is pinned to a DIFFERENT Google account
    sso_failed            the backstop: anything not enumerated above

THIS LIST IS A CONTRACT with `messageFor` in
apps/web/src/app/features/login/login.component.ts and with the table in
docs/google-sign-in.md. Adding a code in one place and not the others is
invisible to pytest, tsc and ng build alike, and it lands the student on the
"reason unknown to this page" fallback â which is exactly what happened the
first time these three lists were written independently.

# Brute-force limiting for POST /login.
#
# Google sign-in carries its own rate limiting, its own anomaly detection and
# usually the college's 2FA. A password carries none of that, so the moment
# PASSWORD_LOGIN=true puts this endpoint on the public internet it becomes the
# one guessable way in — and the Main Admin's password guessed here reads every
# student's marks, attendance and USN. This is the compensating control, and it
# is why that flag was not simply `not is_prod`.
#
# KEYED ON THE ACCOUNT, AND DELIBERATELY NOT ON THE SOURCE ADDRESS.
# registration.py's limiter keys on request.client.host and says in its own
# comment that behind a reverse proxy that is the PROXY. This deployment is
# behind an ALB, so request.client.host is one value for the entire internet:
# an address bucket there is not merely weak, it is a global outage waiting to
# happen — ten wrong passwords from anyone would lock out every student at once
# — and raising the limit until that stops hurting makes it stop working. It
# was tried, and the test suite caught exactly that: every login in the run
# shares the TestClient's single peer address, so the whole suite 429'd after
# ten deliberate wrong-password assertions.
#
# Counting failures per EMAIL is what actually bounds guessing at one account,
# and it holds however many source addresses the guesser has. What it does not
# bound is SPRAYING — one guess each against a thousand accounts — and no
# in-process counter can, behind a proxy that hides the caller. That control
# belongs at the edge (a WAF rate rule on the ALB or CloudFront), and saying so
# here is better than a bucket that pretends to cover it.
#
# ONLY FAILURES COUNT, and a success clears the bucket. Counting successes
# would log a busy shared-lab account out of its own door; leaving the bucket
# full after a correct password would punish the person who got in.
#
# Deliberately accepted limits, in the same spirit as registration.py's note:
#   * In-process, so each ECS task holds its own counters and the effective
#     limit is (tasks x _LOGIN_MAX_FAILURES). With autoscaling that is a real
#     weakening; it is still a hard bound per task, and a shared-state limiter
#     needs Redis or a table this endpoint does not have. Say so rather than
#     implying a guarantee that is not there.
#   * An attacker who knows an address can lock it out of PASSWORD sign-in for
#     the window by burning its budget. That is why the refusal names Google as
#     the way in that still works: Google is unaffected by this counter, so the
#     denial-of-service costs a real user a redirect, not their access.

# away — a human at a terminal with AWS credentials, by this repo's own design
# (deploy.yml ships code and never infrastructure). Meanwhile issuing a KEY is
# one ops-task run away. So an operator who had just deliberately issued the
# first password would then be asked to make the same decision a second time,
# in a different tool, and until they did the login screen would show a form
# that 403s on every submission.
#
# Two sources of truth for one door is how a door ends up saying "open" over a
# lock nobody has a key to, or "shut" while keys are in circulation. So there is
# one: the door is open exactly when at least one account holds a real
# `scrypt:` hash. Nothing self-issues a key — grant_access and seed_roster write
# the SSO-only sentinel, app.seed refuses on ENV=prod — so "a key exists" can
# only mean "an operator ran set_password or grant_access --password-hash on
# purpose". The act of issuing the first key IS the decision to open the door.
#
# The env variable survives as the OVERRIDE, not the switch: PASSWORD_LOGIN=true
# forces open (a dev box with no keys yet), PASSWORD_LOGIN=false forces shut
# even with keys issued (incident response: shut the door, keep the hashes for
# later), and dev/CI are always open because the suite signs in through this
# endpoint. Blank means derive.

# One device at a time
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
#
# A REEP account may hold exactly ONE live session. Signing in anywhere signs
# the account out everywhere else; the newest sign-in wins and the older device
# is dropped on its next request.
#
# The mechanism is the one that already existed for logout: `users.token_version`
# rides in the token, and app/security.py refuses any token whose version is
# BEHIND the row. Advancing the row at sign-in therefore retires every session
# minted before it, without a sessions table, a device list, or any new state to
# keep consistent. The alternative — recording devices and refusing the second —
# would need a store, an eviction policy, and an answer for the student whose
# browser crashed and who now cannot get back in until a row expires.
#
# TWO HALVES, DELIBERATELY, because they belong at different moments:
#
#   `_retire_other_sessions` is the in-memory half. It advances the column and
#   nothing else; THE CALLER'S COMMIT IS WHAT PERSISTS IT. It is called before
#   `_payload_for` so the token carries the new version, and the commit it rides
#   on is the one the sign-in path was already making (`_record_login`). Folding
#   it into that commit is not tidiness: on the code-login path the same
#   transaction also lands the one-time code's `consumed_at`, and a separate
#   earlier commit would make "code spent, session refused" reachable.
#
#   `_confirm_exclusive_session` is the cache half, and MUST run after the
#   commit. It seeds this worker so the retired tokens stop working here at once
#   rather than at the end of the revocation cache window.
#
# THE HONEST CONSEQUENCE, in the same terms app/security.py already uses for
# logout: if the commit fails, the new session is still issued and the older
# devices stay signed in until their tokens expire. That is fail-open on the
# exclusivity, not on authentication, and it is logged where it happens. Making
# it fail-closed would mean refusing a correct password because a streak row
# could not be written.

    Google remains the door this codebase recommends, and on a default

    â not deleted â because tests/conftest.py's `login` fixture and the six test
    modules that use it (test_auth_rbac, test_conversations, test_feedback,
    test_knowledge, test_metrics, test_orchestrator) authenticate through it, and
    an OAuth round-trip cannot be driven from a TestClient without stubbing
    Google. An operator who wants the same door for real people opens it
    deliberately, with one .env value, having read what it costs.

    THE DOOR IS `password_door_open(db)`, one answer shared with /sso/status:
    dev/CI always; PASSWORD_LOGIN=true always; PASSWORD_LOGIN=false never; and
    otherwise open exactly when some account holds a real scrypt hash — because
    a key can only exist if an operator issued one on purpose, and that act is
    the decision (see the note above password_keys_exist). Never `not is_prod`:
    `staging`, a typo, an empty ENV from a broken deploy all stay shut until a
    key is deliberately issued. The one query the guard runs is independent of
    the request, so it cannot be probed for WHICH accounts exist — only for the
    bit the login screen's probe already publishes.

    WHAT OPENING IT TAKES ON. A password is guessable where a Google account

    change: accounts have no usable password until `python -m app.set_password`
    is run for one BY NAME (grant_access and seed_roster mint the unusable
    SSO_ONLY_PASSWORD_HASH sentinel), and `app.seed` still refuses on ENV=prod,

    THE REFUSAL IS THE FEATURE. `users.google_sub` is what proves the person
    signing in with Google is the same person as last time; clearing it is the
    only way to hand a roster row to a new holder when an institutional address
    is re-issued. It is also, for an account that has no password, the act of
    deleting your own only door -- and REEP mints exactly that account by
    design: `grant_access` and `seed_roster` write SSO_ONLY_PASSWORD_HASH, a
    sentinel `verify_password` can never match. So the guard is not defensive
    programming, it is the commonest case.

    TWO CONDITIONS, not one, because "a password exists" is not the same as "a
    password works". `password_door_open(db)` is the single answer /login and
    /sso/status already share, and on a deployment that has set
    PASSWORD_LOGIN=false a real scrypt hash opens nothing at all. Checking only
    the hash would cheerfully lock somebody out of a deployment whose password
    door is bolted -- which is the exact outcome this endpoint exists to
    prevent, arriving through the check that was meant to prevent it.

    IT DOES NOT SIGN ANYBODY OUT. Unlinking changes which doors exist, not who
    is at the keyboard, and retiring the session would mean the person is thrown
    to a login screen at the precise moment they have one fewer way through it.
