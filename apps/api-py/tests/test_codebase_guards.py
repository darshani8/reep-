#: Where the word may still legitimately appear, and why.
#:
#:  * PROGRAM DIRECTOR is a job title PRINTED ON THE COLLEGE'S OWN LEAVE FORM.
#:    The second approver signs that block, `leave.py` fills `director_name` /
#:    `director_decided_at` / `director_note` for it, and `leave_paper.py` draws
#:    it at coordinates measured from the office's PDF. Renaming any of that
#:    would change a paper form nobody in this repo owns.
#:  * `Role.DIRECTOR` survives as an ENUM VALUE. A Postgres enum value cannot be
#:    dropped without recreating the type, the migration converts the rows, and
#:    `test_no_director_privilege.py` needs to be able to MINT one to prove it
#:    reaches nothing.
#:  * The removal's own record — governance.py, policies.py, grant_access.py,
#:    seed.py — has to say the word to explain what was removed and why.
#:
#: What this guard is actually for is the OTHER kind: a new `/api/director/*`
#: route, a `features/director/` folder, a `require_director`, an OpenAPI tag.
#: Those all existed on 2026-09-10 and were renamed; nothing stops them being
#: typed again, and the last time half of them survived a removal the result was
#: a role that passed fifty capability gates while failing every role gate.

# §35  The nightly sweep never reaches identity                                #
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
#
# `app/retention.py` runs unattended every night and DELETES. It is the one
# scheduled destructor in the product, and the column it must never reach is the
# one that decides whether a student can sign in at all.
#
# It does not reach it today: the module imports no `User` and no `Student`, and
# writes to six tables, none of which is `users` or `students`. That is a fact
# nothing asserts, which is the wrong standard for this particular fact — a
# durability review of this codebase asked for exactly this guard and was right
# to.
#
# WHAT THE OBVIOUS VERSION OF THIS GUARD GETS WRONG, twice, because both traps
# cost more than the guard does:
#
#   1. "Identity is out of scope for every destructor" is FALSE and cannot be
#      made to pass. `users` is deliberately IN scope for both purge modules —
#      `VERDICTS["users"] is SURVIVOR`, `STUDENT_VERDICTS["users"] is ACCOUNTS`
#      — because deleting accounts is what they are FOR, and their own tests
#      already pin that. A guard written to those words either fails on the day
#      it lands or gets quietly weakened into one that asserts nothing. The
#      subject here is the SWEEP, which deletes on a clock with nobody watching,
#      not the destructors, which delete because a human typed a sentence.
#
#   2. An import guard is ONE CALL TOO SHALLOW. `purge_expired` calls
#      `sweep_login_codes`, which lives in `app/account_links.py` — and that
#      module DOES import `User`, because it is where activation and reset links
#      are minted. A guard that reads only `retention.py`'s import list stays
#      green forever while the helper it calls grows a write to `users`. So the
#      helpers are checked in their own file, by name.
#
# An import guard is also blind to `text("DELETE FROM users ...")` by
# construction, so raw SQL is refused outright on this path rather than parsed.

#: not forbidden — it is UNREVIEWED, and adding it to this set is the review.

# §36  A file never reaches the permanent archive without a name              #
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------#
#
# `app/document_archive.py` copies every stored file into a versioned,
# Object-Locked bucket with no lifecycle rule, so the bytes outlive the
# database. The key is the `stored_name`, a bare `uuid4().hex`. The only thing
# that ever knows whose file that was is the `archived_documents` row written
# beside it, and the only writer of that row is
# `document_manifest.save_and_record`.
#
# A router that calls `document_store.save_bytes` directly therefore puts a
# file into a permanent archive that nothing can ever name — undiscoverable,
# undeletable, and indistinguishable from every other uuid in the bucket.
#
# THIS IS THE SAME FAILURE THE QUOTA HAD, ONE LAYER UP. `document_store`'s own
# docstring records it: the comment claimed enforcement lived in "the single
# caller of save_bytes", and three writers later `routers/alumni.py` had no
# quota check at all. The fix then was to move the arithmetic into the store
# and refuse a caller that brings no `VolumeQuota`. The store cannot host this
# one — a manifest row needs a `Session` and the store holds no ORM, which is
# what lets it be tested with four integers — so the enforcement is this guard.

# §37  The console's buttons: a glyph the font has, a gate the route checks   #
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------#
#
# Two facts about the Main Admin console live in TypeScript DATA rather than
# in templates, and both were invisible to every existing check.
#
# ICONS. The icon font is SUBSET to tools/fonts/icon-names.txt (plus the
# declared extras), and a glyph outside it renders as NOTHING — no box, no
# word, an empty 22px square where the button's picture should be.
# `collect-icon-names.py` reads TEMPLATES, so the ligatures the sidebar and the
# Home carry as `icon: 'xyz'` in a `.ts` file are exactly the ones it cannot
# find. Both files are read here as text and every `icon:` literal is checked
# against the subset.
#
# GATES. The shell's own rule is that a navigation row is gated on EXACTLY what
# its route guard checks — gated on less, the row is a link the guard bounces
# back to /admin with nothing on screen saying so. Ten rows had no gate at all
# on 2026-09-15 (harmless only because the Main Admin holds every admin.* key
# by baseline) and the vitest spec beside the shell found it by comparing the
# rows against Home. This is the same comparison against the route table:
# `capabilityGuard('k')` on a route means `capability: 'k'` on its row and
# button; `roleGuard('ADMIN')` means `mainAdminOnly: true`.
