/**
 * The REEP chart theme: ECharts wearing the design system.
 *
 * Registered once per chunk that draws a chart, then named on every
 * `echarts.init` in it. Registration ALONE changes nothing — ECharts applies a
 * theme at init, so a chart created with `init(el, undefined, …)` stays on the
 * library's defaults however many themes are registered. That was the state of
 * the analytics screen before this file: two charts, both initialised with
 * `undefined`.
 *
 * WHY THE COLOURS ARE LITERALS. ECharts draws to a canvas or to SVG it
 * generates itself, and it resolves nothing through the CSS cascade: a
 * `var(--brand-purple)` handed to a series is passed through to the renderer
 * and drawn as an invalid colour. These are the values reep-v2.scss declares,
 * and tools/ci/check_theme_tokens.py fails if the two disagree.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT IN HERE. The status colours and the per-track colours are
 * exported as named maps below rather than as extra keys on the theme object.
 * The design kit's JSON carried them as `_status` and `_tracks`; ECharts
 * copies unknown top-level keys onto the option, where they do nothing, and a
 * chart that needs "the colour for Business Analytics" wants to look it up by
 * name rather than by palette position.
 *
 * WHERE THIS MAY BE IMPORTED. Lazily-loaded routes only — see the same note in
 * shared/grid/reep-grid-theme.ts. The initial bundle is held to 400 kB and
 * ECharts is far larger than that on its own.
