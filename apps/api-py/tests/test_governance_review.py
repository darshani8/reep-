"""B2.4 and B2.5: a grant needs two people, a review date, and the right role.

Three properties, and every one of them fails SILENTLY if it regresses — the
console still renders, the endpoint still answers 200, and the damage is a
faculty member holding a student's records on one person's say-so, or holding
them still after they stopped being faculty.

  * A capability the catalogue flags `carries_pii` is written
    `pending_approval` and holds NOTHING until a different holder of
    `admin.governance` approves it. The approver may not be the granter, and
    that one refusal is the only part of a four-eyes rule that does anything.
  * Every reader of a grant honours the pending state. There are four of them
    and they are in three files; one forgetting is one door left open.
  * A grant describes a person IN A ROLE. Change the role and it stops counting
    — and `grant_access` also revokes it explicitly, so the office can see that
    it is gone rather than only that it does not work.
