/**
 * Student feature switches — the Main Admin's student-facing switches.
 *
 * Board: docs/redesign-2026-09/design/admin/FeatureSwitches.html
 * Spec:  docs/redesign-2026-09/02-admin-console-spec.md §20
 *
 * ITS OWN SCREEN, NOT A TAB ON GOVERNANCE. Roles & functions answers "who may
 * SEE a console screen"; this one answers "what is a STUDENT shown". The two
 * instruments have opposite defaults — a capability is denied past the role
 * baseline, a feature is allowed until somebody switches it off — and one
 * screen carrying both puts "grant" and "take away" in the same place.
 *
 * THE ENFORCEMENT COLUMN IS THE POINT OF THIS SCREEN, and B2.2 made it the
 * SERVER'S answer rather than this screen's guess. `GET /governance/catalogue`
 * now serves `enforced` per feature and every override row carries
 * `feature_enforced`, so the column is read straight off the payload. The Phase
 * 2 screen carried a hand-audited `SERVER_ENFORCED_FEATURE_KEYS` constant with a
 * comment saying it was right only on the day it was written; it is deleted, not
 * edited, because that was always its own terms. A switch the server never reads
 * is not a switch — it is a row in a table and a promise to a student that
 * nothing keeps — and rendering every key as "Server-enforced" because the column
 * looks better that way would let an admin switch the mock interviewer off for a
 * first-semester batch, watch the row save, and find sixty students sitting
 * interviews the next morning.
 *
 * SO THE SWITCH IS DISABLED PER ROW, ON THE SERVER'S OWN FACT. `PUT /features`
 * answers **422** for a feature whose `enforced` is false — in BOTH directions,
 * because an `enabled: true` row on an unwired key is equally a promise the API
 * does not keep — so the rule form is drawn disabled for exactly those rows and
 * says why. Not a phase constant: every feature in today's catalogue is
 * enforced, so a blanket "Available with Phase 3" would grey out eleven working
 * switches, and the day a twelfth key is added unwired the screen has to notice
 * without anybody editing it. REMOVE stays live on an unwired row — DELETE has
 * no enforcement check and a stale rule must always be clearable.
 *
 * THE STUDENT-FACING MESSAGE IS EDITABLE (B2.2). `student_message` is a column,
 * it is on `OverrideIn`/`OverrideOut`, and the router writes it onto the audit
 * trail beside the rule, because "what were they told" is the question somebody
 * asks afterwards. It is NOT `reason`: the reason is the office's note to itself
 * ("withheld pending the disciplinary meeting" is a true reason and not a
 * sentence to put on somebody's screen), the message is what the student reads.
 * Blank is a real choice — the feature is then simply absent from their console.
 *
 * THE COLLEGE SELECT IS A SCOPE PICKER AND STAYS DISABLED — see
 * `COLLEGE_PICKER_IS_THE_SERVERS` below for why that is not a stale phase badge.

 * about a release rather than a fact about a control, and the honest reason has
 * to replace it: THE SERVER DECIDES REACH (`B1.4`). `GET /governance/features`,
 * `/catalogue` and `/hierarchy` take no college parameter — they answer with
 * whatever the caller's own grants reach — so there is nothing for this control
 * to send, and posting a college the API would ignore is the dead-control
 * failure `PendingControlDirective` exists to prevent.
 *
 * Nor can it honestly become a client-side filter over the rows already
 * fetched. Every institutional rung resolves up to a college through
 * `hierarchy.parent_id`, but a STUDENT-scope rule does not: the hierarchy
 * endpoint does not list students, so a student-level rule has no college this
 * screen can name — and those are the most specific rules on the board, the
