/**
 * Registrations — the Main Admin's review queue (spec §10, board
 * `design/admin/Registrations.html`).
 *
 * WHAT APPROVAL ACTUALLY DOES, because this screen used to say the opposite.
 * `POST /api/register/{id}/decision` with APPROVE now mints the User row, the
 * Student row seated in the rule's batch and a profile row, moves the CV and
 * photo onto that student's uploads, and emails the onboarding link — all in
 * one transaction (`_provision_student` in `app/routers/registration.py`, and
 * AGENTS.md, "Approval provisions, and two guards make that safe"). The copy
 * here said "Approval PROVISIONS NOTHING on its own" and "creating the Student
 * row is a separate step server-side", which was true of the endpoint that
 * shipped first and has been wrong since. That is B11.4, and it is the one
 * task on this screen that is a client change: it is fixed here.
 *
 * WHAT IS LIVE, AND ON WHICH ENDPOINT.
 *   GET  /api/register/pending            the queue. NO PARAMETERS is the
 *                                         historical unbounded pending list and
 *                                         is what the Pending tab asks for;
 *                                         `?status=&limit=` is the other three
 *                                         tabs (B11.2)
 *   POST /api/register/{id}/decision      approve, and reject WITH A REASON —
 *                                         the API answers 422 without one and
 *                                         this screen refuses before posting
 *   POST /api/register/{id}/hold          park it WITH A NOTE, same shape: 422
 *                                         without one, refused here first
 *   POST /api/register/{id}/reopen        back in the queue — the Rejected
 *                                         tab's Undo AND the Held tab's release,
 *                                         because they are one act
 *   GET  /api/register/rules              the Seating rules drawer, read-only
 *   GET  /api/register/hierarchy          batch names for the queue and the
 *                                         College / Batch filters (public, and
 *                                         reachable by a grantee who holds
 *                                         `admin.registrations` and nothing
 *                                         else — `/api/admin/cohorts` is not,
 *                                         it asks for `admin.analytics`)
 *
 * THE CHECKS ARE THE SERVER'S NOW (B11.1). Every row of `GET /pending` carries
 * `checks[]`: the rule engine's verdict, the college domain fence, whose account
 * this address already is, and the USN. Three of those are the guards
 * `_provision_student` applies when Approve is pressed, read out BEFORE the
 * press — so a red line here and a 4xx there are one answer and not two, which
 * is only true because this screen renders what it is given and recomputes
 * nothing. The client's own guess at the rule check is gone for that reason.
 * The batch line and the two attachment lines stay client-side: neither is a
 * guard and neither can contradict a decision.
 *
 * THERE IS NO SEAT CHECK AND THERE IS NOT GOING TO BE ONE. The board draws
 * "60 of 60 seats"; `cohorts` has no capacity column and 04 §B11.1 asks for
 * none. A nullable one would render as "no check" on every batch nobody had
 * filled in — grey exactly where it would matter — and seating capacity is a
 * course-shape decision that belongs with the catalogue. The notice under the
 * checklist used to promise it under B11.1 and now says plainly that nothing
 * counts seats.
 *
 * THE FOUR TABS ARE LIVE (B11.2). They were drawn disabled because the queue
 * could only be asked for one hard-coded status; `?status=` is that gap closed.
 * HOLD is the new one and it is INTERNAL: a note a reviewer writes about an
 * application for colleagues, no mail, nothing the applicant can see. A held
 * application is still decidable, is still counted on the Analytics pending
 * tile, and can still receive the document it is being held for.
 *
 * WHAT IS STILL NOT LIVE: creating and editing seating rules (B11.3), which is
 * the one remaining disabled control on this screen and says so.
 *
 * BULK IS THE LOOP, deliberately. There is no bulk decision endpoint; "Approve
 * 3 selected" is three POSTs and the notice says how many landed. A failure
 * stops the run rather than pressing on, because the reviewer needs to know
 * which application refused and why.

 * because a spreadsheet strips the quotes and then evaluates what is left.
 *
 * THE APOSTROPHE BELOW IS DELIBERATE AND IT IS NOT A BUG. A leading `'` is the
 * spreadsheets' own "the rest of this cell is text" marker: it lands INSIDE
 * the quotes AG Grid adds, so the file reads `"'=HYPERLINK(…)"`, and Excel and
 * Sheets show the cell as the literal text without displaying the apostrophe.
