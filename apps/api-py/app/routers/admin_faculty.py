"""Faculty accounts, created and offboarded by the Main Admin on screen.

  POST   /api/admin/faculty                        create the login (B3.1, B3.2)
  GET    /api/admin/faculty[?unfiled=true]         every faculty account (B3.1)
  PATCH  /api/admin/faculty/{user_id}              identity + filing (B3.5)
  POST   /api/admin/users/{user_id}/disable        offboard (B3.3)
  POST   /api/admin/users/{user_id}/enable         within 90 days (B3.3)
  POST   /api/admin/users/{user_id}/sign-out-everywhere   (B3.6)

Until 2026-09 a faculty login was minted only by `python -m app.grant_access` -
on a production host, the GitHub "Ops task" workflow - and its activation link
was read out of a run log. This is that same act on the Faculty & Students
screen: the Main Admin types a name and an address, the account is created,
and the ACTIVATION LINK is shown on screen to hand over (WhatsApp, in person),
because production cannot send mail yet and the on-screen link is permanent
by design (routers/admin.py::issue_activation_link).

ADMIN ONLY (`require_admin`): the owner's rule is that only the Main Admin
gives faculty their access, and an account is the first grant of all.

WHAT THE ACCOUNT IS. Role MENTOR; the unusable password sentinel, so nothing
signs in until the person redeems the link and sets their own password (or
Google, once configured); NO `Mentor` group - a faculty member becomes a
mentor when the Main Admin assigns them a student
(routers/admin_mentoring.py). An
address already in `users` is refused - a MENTOR row must never be attached to
someone else's account.

THE ADDRESS IS NOW FENCED TO THE COLLEGE'S DOMAINS (B3.2), which is a reversal
of what this module used to say. The old argument was that grant_access does
not fence either and that the Main Admin minting the row deliberately IS the
check. That held while there was one college and one operator. It stops holding
the moment there are two, because "one of ours" becomes "one of THEIRS", and a
typo in a domain (gmail.com for the college's own) mints a REEP account on an
address the institution does not control - which is a roster row, and the roster
is the access control. So the fence is the college's `email_domains`
(app/institution_domains.py, B1.1), with the deployment's env list as the
fallback for a college that has recorded none. An address outside it is still
mintable, because a visiting lecturer on a personal address is a real case - but
only with `allow_external` AND a written reason, and both land in the audit row.

OFFBOARDING IS A COLUMN, NOT A DELETE (B3.3). `users.disabled_at` and its two
companions; nothing the person wrote is removed, because the mentor notes, the
sanctioned leave and the verified evidence are parts of OTHER people's records
and were true when they were written. Deleting a faculty account is
`python -m app.purge_people`'s business and nothing else's.

    THREE WRITES AND NO DELETES. `disabled_at` (the check every door reads,
    through app/security.py's one lookup), `token_version + 1` (the live
    sessions, which app/security.py refuses on their next request), and every
    outstanding activation/reset/onboarding link consumed. Everything the person
    wrote stays: their mentor notes are part of a student's record, the leave
    they sanctioned is on somebody's form, the evidence they verified is the
    reason a badge exists. Emptying a deployment of people is
    `python -m app.purge_people`, which dry-runs by default and says so.

    IT NOW RELEASES THEIR MENTEES (B9.1), which this docstring used to say it
    deliberately did not. The old sentence was right about ACCESS - a disabled
    account cannot make a request, so a mentee still pointing at it was never a
    leak - and wrong about the roster: those students sat in a group nobody can
    open, invisible in the unassigned pool, and the office found out when one of
    them asked why their mentor never replied. The release is
    `mentor_history.release_mentees_of`, which unseats each of them, writes a
    `faculty_disabled` history row naming this act, and puts them back in the
    pool the assignment screen draws from. `released` on the response says how
    many, so the admin sees the consequence in the same breath as the act.

    NO HANDOVER GRANT IS MINTED HERE, unlike every other release. The 90-day
    window exists so the previous mentor can still be asked about a note they
    wrote; an offboarded account cannot sign in to answer, and the grant would
    sit on the Governance screen looking like access somebody forgot to revoke.

    IT STILL DOES NOT REVOKE THEIR CAPABILITY GRANTS, and that half stands
    (B2.5): a grant is a permission to make a REQUEST and a disabled account
    cannot make one. `governance.py` owns grants and the office revokes what is
    no longer needed there, with a reason, on the trail.

    REFUSES AN ADMIN, and refuses you. The Main Admin IS the console; disabling
    it locks every human out of the only screen that could switch it back on,
    and there is no second admin by design (`grant_access` refuses to mint one).
    A handover demotes the current office account to MENTOR first, which is the
    path `grant_access` already documents.
