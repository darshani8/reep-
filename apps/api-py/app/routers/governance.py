"""Governance — the Main Admin console's access endpoints.

GATED ON `admin.governance` THROUGHOUT (B2.6), not on the ADMIN role.

It was `require_admin` at every call site, and for good reasons that have not
changed: REEP has one Main Admin, and deciding what faculty may see is that
account's instrument. The capability keeps that as the DEFAULT -- the Main Admin
holds `admin.governance` by baseline and nobody else holds anything -- and adds
one thing the role gate could not express: a DEPUTY. When the office account is
unreachable and a grant has to be made, the alternative to a deputy is sharing
the Main Admin's mailbox, which is worse in every way and leaves an audit trail
naming the wrong person.

So the deputy is a grant like any other: one key, one named faculty member, a
typed reason, an audit row, revocable in one click. `_refuse_second_main_admin`
in `app/grant_access.py` is UNTOUCHED and must stay so -- a deputy is not a
second Main Admin, holds exactly this one key and nothing else, and cannot mint
an ADMIN account. `tests/test_governance_delegation.py` pins both halves.

Two instruments with opposite defaults, kept apart here as
they are in the model:

    /grants    capability grants for staff. Deny past the role baseline.
    /features  student feature overrides. Allow until switched off.

EVERY MUTATION DEMANDS A REASON, and it is checked in the API rather than only in
the form. A governance trail whose entries do not say why is a list of dates, and
a client is not where that promise can be kept — the twenty-character floor is
here so a second client, a script, or a curl cannot skip it.

EVERY MUTATION IS AUDITED through `architecture_events.record_change`, the
existing writer, rather than a second audit table. It already records actor,
entity, action, before/after and the route; a parallel implementation would be
the copy that stops matching.

A `carries_pii` CAPABILITY NEEDS TWO PEOPLE (B2.4). The grant is written
`pending_approval` and holds nothing until a DIFFERENT holder of
`admin.governance` approves it; `granted_capabilities` and `granted_reaches`
both ignore a pending row, so the state is enforced where access is resolved and
not only on the screen that shows it. The approver may not be the granter, which
is the only part of a four-eyes rule that actually does anything.

THE CATALOGUE ENDPOINTS EXIST FOR THE DROPDOWNS. `/catalogue` and `/hierarchy`
serve exactly what the console's selects need, from the same constants the
enforcement reads — so a capability the API does not know can never appear in the
list an admin picks from.
