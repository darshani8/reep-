/**
 * Verifications — the mentor's review queue, and the ONLY place a skill becomes
 * verified or a submitted document stops being "in review".
 *
 * A student files a claim on Skilling; it lands here, for their assigned mentor
 * and nobody else. There is no admin queue, no escalation and no second
 * approver: `GET /mentor/badge-evidence/pending` narrows to the mentor's own
 * group server-side, and the review endpoint re-checks scope, so the routing is
 * a property of the API rather than of this screen.
 *
 * THIS SCREEN READS THE QUEUE THE CLAIM FORM FILES INTO (2026-09-17). The
 * Skilling claim card stores the certificate and posts
 * `POST /student/badges/{code}/evidence` — a row in `badge_evidence`. This
 * screen used to read `GET /mentor/skill-claims/pending`, a different table
 * (`skill_claims`) that no client has written to since the Skilling screen
 * replaced the per-skill claim form. So every claim a student filed went into
 * a queue the mentor's screen never opened, and the mentor's screen showed a
 * queue nothing could fill: "Nothing waiting for your review", for the life of
 * the deployment, over a growing list of real claims. The `skill-claims`
 * endpoints stay on the API for the resume builder's read; this screen no
 * longer reads them.
 *
 * THREE OUTCOMES, AND TWO OF THEM NEED WORDS. Verify grants the badge and
 * lights it — with the blue tick — on the student's board. Request changes
 * sends it back to be redone. Reject refuses it. The last two are
 * indistinguishable from a broken screen if they arrive without a reason — the
 * student sees the note and nothing else, on screen and in the mail the API
 * sends them — so the note is required for both, enforced here for the message
 * and again in the API (422) for the guarantee.
 *
 * ONE DECISION, BOTH ROWS. The certificate behind a claim was written
 * PENDING_REVIEW by the upload and used to appear in the Documents queue below
 * AS WELL, decidable separately and in the opposite direction. The review
 * endpoint now writes the claim's verdict onto the certificate too, and the
 * Documents queue leaves out a file a pending claim is standing on. A document
 * listed below is therefore one no claim explains: a photo, an offer letter, a
 * report — reviewed on its own.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SHOWS IS WHAT A CLAIM ACTUALLY CARRIES: the badge and its
 * category, the kind of evidence, its title, who issued it, the file's name,
 * the student's note. A level and an outcome metric were on an earlier form
 * and are not collected, so they are not drawn as empty rows.
 *
 * "Recently reviewed" is the same scope, read back: `GET /badge-evidence/
 * reviewed` lists decided claims newest first, with the note the student was
 * given, so a decision does not vanish the moment it is made.
 *
 * THE DOCUMENT QUEUE IS THE SAME SCOPE. Every file a student uploads — a
 * profile photo, an offer letter, an internship report — is written
 * PENDING_REVIEW, and `POST /mentor/uploads/{id}/review` is the only production
 * writer of VERIFIED or REJECTED on that row. It is reviewed here because it
 * is the same reviewer, the same mentor group and the same
 * `_assert_can_access_student` gate.
 *
 * TWO OUTCOMES THERE, NOT THREE. `UploadStatus` carries NEEDS_CHANGES and the
 * upload review endpoint does not accept it: the body is VERIFY or REJECT and
 * anything else is a 422. Adding "Request changes" for symmetry with the claim
 * queue would be a button that always fails. The note is required here before
 * a REJECT and — unlike the claim queue — that rule is NOT mirrored in the API
 * (`UploadReviewIn.note` is optional); do not describe it to a student as
 * enforced, and do not delete it on the grounds that the server does not ask.
