"""Conversation service — the ONE place conversations are resolved and written.

Every assistant surface (text chat, streaming, voice worker) codes against this
exact contract. The ownership rule lives here: a conversation is derived from the
authenticated user, and any id that must travel in a URL is checked with
assert_owner before it is trusted. No endpoint ever accepts a client-chosen
conversation id to decide whose data to read or write.

The lifecycle rule lives here too: a cleared (or purged) conversation accepts no
further turns. append_message refuses with ConversationGone rather than letting a
long-running voice or interview session keep writing into the thread its student
just discarded — see that function's call-site contract before you catch it.

    CALL-SITE CONTRACT — this RAISES ConversationGone when the thread has been
    cleared or purged. It does not return a sentinel, and no caller may treat
    the refusal as a no-op:

      * In a request handler, map it to 404 — the same answer assert_owner
        already gives for a cleared thread, so the client hears one story about
        a conversation that is gone whichever layer noticed. (POST
        /api/voice/transcript checks and 404s before it gets here, so its
        worker-facing contract is unchanged.)
      * In a fire-and-forget writer, let it propagate to that writer's own
        `except Exception` — the connection id and the provider turn id live
        there, and the log line is not diagnosable without them — and then END
        THE SESSION. Both realtime callers resolve conversation_id ONCE at
        socket open and reuse it for up to fifteen minutes, so this is a state
        change that happens mid-call, not one they could have checked at open;
        and one dropped-turn line per turn for the rest of that call is noise
        wrapped around a record that is already lost.

    Never fold it into an `except IntegrityError`. Both fire-and-forget writers
    treat IntegrityError as the genuinely idempotent no-op it is (the dedup lost
    a race; the turn IS stored by the other writer), and a refusal swallowed by
    that branch is precisely the silent loss this guard exists to end.
