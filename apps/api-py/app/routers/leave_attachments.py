"""The papers that came with a leave request (B10.3).

    POST   /api/leaves/{id}/attachments              attach one
    GET    /api/leaves/{id}/attachments              list them
    GET    /api/leaves/{id}/attachments/{aid}/file   download one
    DELETE /api/leaves/{id}/attachments/{aid}        remove one

ITS OWN MODULE, FOR `app/routers/leave_paper.py`'S REASON. `routers/leave.py`
holds the form's submit and decide paths, which the owner asked to leave exactly
as they are; it gains nothing here. What this module needs from it — the scope
rule — is IMPORTED, never restated.

==============================================================================
THE READ GATE IS THE PAPER'S, AND EVERY REFUSAL IS THE SAME 404
==============================================================================

What is attached to a leave request is medical or personal by construction: a
certificate for the `reason` that reads "post-operative review", the letter for
an OOD. So the question "may this account see this request" is asked exactly
where the PDF asks it — `leave._assert_can_decide` -> `mentor._assert_can_access_student`
-> `policies.assert_student_scope` — with the applicant's own id as the only
other door.

Every refusal is flattened to the same `Leave request not found.` a missing id
gets, for `_assert_can_decide`'s reason: told apart, these endpoints are a
membership oracle over the whole programme (guess ids, read the error, learn who
has leave pending and what they attached). The one refusal that is NOT flattened
is the role gate inside `_assert_can_decide`, which answers 403 before any id is
looked at — identical for a real and an invented id, so it leaks nothing.

==============================================================================
THE STORE'S LIMITS ARE THE STORE'S, AND THEY ARE NOT RESTATED HERE
==============================================================================

`app/document_store.py` decides the accepted types by MAGIC BYTES (PDF / PNG /
JPEG) and caps one file at `MAX_BYTES` (10 MB). 04's "PDF/JPEG/PNG <= 10 MB" is
exactly that, already enforced, and a copy of it in this router is a second
place to be wrong. What belongs here is the COUNTING, which the store cannot do
because it needs this table and must stay free of the ORM.

THE QUOTA IS TWO-PHASE AND THE ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING. `check_slot()` runs BEFORE
the body is read, so an owner already at their file count never gets their
megabytes buffered into this process at all; `check_bytes()` runs after, inside
`save_bytes`, when the size is finally known. A single combined check would have
to read first, which is the denial of service the count cap exists to stop.

THE TWO NUMBERS ARE COUNTED AGAINST DIFFERENT OWNERS, and `document_store` says
why at length: `MAX_LEAVE_ATTACHMENTS_PER_REQUEST` over THIS REQUEST's rows (a
request carrying more than a handful is a mis-click or a scanner spraying a page
per file), `MAX_LEAVE_ATTACHMENT_BYTES_PER_USER` over THIS UPLOADER's rows
across every request (the disk does not care which request the megabytes arrived
on). One `VolumeQuota` carries both, so the three refusals stay the store's:
`ShelfFull` -> 409, `AllowanceExceeded` -> 413, `UploadRejected` -> 422.
`QuotaRejected` is deliberately not a subclass of `UploadRejected`, so catching
them in that order is not a style choice — reversed, a full shelf would tell the
uploader their valid PDF was malformed.

DOWNLOADS ARE `attachment`, NEVER INLINE. `content_disposition` defaults to it
and that default is a security posture: the SPA and the API are same-origin, and
a PDF rendered inline runs its embedded JavaScript in that origin — uploaded by
one applicant, opened by the approver reading it. The magic-byte sniff cannot
help, because the payload IS a valid PDF.

RULE 1 is not in play: nothing here reaches a model, and the bytes never leave
the volume.
