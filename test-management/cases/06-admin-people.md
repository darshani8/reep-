# Admin: people and access

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Screens | `/admin`, `/admin/students`, `/admin/students/:id`, `/admin/faculty`, `/admin/faculty/new`, `/admin/mentors`, `/admin/governance`, `/admin/governance/features`, `/admin/audit` |
| Automated tests | [`tests/06-admin-people.spec.ts`](../../tests/06-admin-people.spec.ts) |
| ID range | TC-500 to TC-599 |

Setup, the seeded accounts and the rules that link these cases to their
automated tests are in [the index](../manual-test-cases.md).

Every case below starts from the same place unless its own pre-conditions say
otherwise: the web app and the API are running as described in "Setup" in the
index, with a development `ENV` (no mail transport, so links and codes are
printed to the API console instead of being emailed), the dev seed has been
applied, and you are signed in as the Main Admin, `admin@bgscet.ac.in`. Use a
browser window about 1920 pixels wide, so that every column of the roster and
faculty grids is on screen; in a narrower window, scroll a grid sideways to
read the columns on its right.

Several cases need a throwaway faculty member or student of their own, so that
nothing seeded is disabled, removed or deleted:

- **A new faculty member**: on `/admin/faculty/new`, file one under
  "MGMT · Department of Management Studies" with a unique name and a unique
  `@bgscet.ac.in` address (TC-517 walks through it), and keep the activation
  link it shows.
- **An activated faculty member**: a new faculty member whose activation link
  has been opened in a private window and a password of at least 12
  characters set on it (TC-520 walks through it).
- **A new student**: submit `/register` with a unique name, a unique
  `@bgscet.ac.in` address and a USN that is not of the form `1BG2?MBA???`, so
  that no rule seats them in a batch, then approve the application on
  `/admin/registrations`. A new student has never signed in, so their Status
  reads "Invited"; they start at stage Excel, in semester 1.
- **A new batch**: on College structure (`/admin/institution`), add a batch
  under Department of Management Studies, course Master of Business
  Administration, with a unique name, running from 1 Jul 2026 to 30 Jun 2028.
  Move the students a case names into it with the pencil on the roster (Batch).
  Other test runs leave students, some of them removed from the roster, in the
  seeded batch, and a batch action writes to every student seated in the
  batch, so the cases about a whole batch use a batch of their own. When a
  case moves Test Student into it, move them back to "Master of Business
  Administration - Finance · 2024-26 Section B" afterwards, in semester 2 at
  stage Excel-Adv, then delete the empty batch ("Batch actions", "Remove this
  empty batch…").

Other test modules leave data behind (more students, removed accounts, more
colleges and departments), so the cases below name the seeded records they
check and give counts as they read on a freshly seeded database. Where a count
on screen depends on what else exists, the case says so.

The automated tests make these through the API, with names unique to the run,
and remove them again when the case ends. Removed accounts stay on the Removed
lists, record kept: deleting for good needs a code emailed to the office, which
no automated test reads.

| ER-3 | 5 | The dialog opens again. |
| ER-4 | 6 | The screen says "1 student: set to Elevate." and Test Student's Stage column reads Elevate. |

### Post-conditions

The audit trail has a `cohort` event for the batch with the action
`STUDENTS_SEMESTER` and one with `STUDENTS_STAGE`. Put Test Student back in
the seeded batch, in semester 2 at stage Excel-Adv, and delete the empty batch

## TC-539 — A batch action writes only to the students its dialog counts

| Field | Value |
|---|---|

| Module | Admin: students roster, batch actions |
| Priority | P2 |
| Type | Functional, negative (known defect) |
| Automated test | `tests/06-admin-people.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-539` |

### Pre-conditions

1. The common pre-conditions at the top of this file.
2. Test Student, in semester 2 as seeded, has been moved into a new batch
   (see the top of this file). A new student, in semester 1, has been moved
   into it too and then removed from the roster (the pencil on their row,
   "Remove or delete…", a reason, "Remove from the roster"; see TC-515), so the
   roster lists only Test Student in the batch.

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Batch | The new batch |
| Semester to set | 3 |

### Steps

1. Open `/admin/students`.
2. Under "Batch", choose the new batch.
3. Click "Batch actions".
4. Under "Set semester", choose `3` and click the Set button beside it.
5. Under "Status", choose "Removed · off the roster, record kept".

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 3 | The dialog says "Every action here touches all 1 student in this batch — the filters above do not narrow it." |
| ER-2 | 4 | The screen says "1 student: set to semester 3.", the one student the dialog counted. |
| ER-3 | 5 | The removed student is listed and is still in semester 1: a student off the roster is not moved by an action whose dialog did not count them. |

### Known defect

The action writes to every student seated in the batch, including removed
ones, and counts them: the screen says "2 students: set to semester 3." under a
dialog that said "all 1 student", and the removed student's Sem column reads 3.
The API selects the batch's students without leaving out removed accounts
(`apps/api-py/app/routers/admin_students.py`, the batch action, around line
636), while the dialog counts the roster, which does.

### Post-conditions

Test Student's Sem column reads 3. Put them back in the seeded batch, in
semester 2 at stage Excel-Adv, move the removed student out of the batch and
delete the empty batch (see the top of this file). The removed student stays on
the Removed list. The automated test does this through the API.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 2 | The toolbar button reads "Assign faculty to 1 selected" and the bar under the grid reads "Selected: 1". |
| ER-2 | 3 | A dialog "Assign a faculty member" opens, saying "1 student ticked in the grid.". Each faculty member is offered with their load: the number of students they have now "of" the capacity, as the Mentor load screen (`/admin/mentors`) counts them. On a freshly seeded database that is "Test Mentor — 1 of 20" and "<new faculty member> — 0 of 20". |
| ER-3 | 4 | The dialog closes, the screen says "1 of 1 student: assigned to <new faculty member>." and the Faculty column names the new faculty member. |
| ER-4 | 5 | The edit dialog opens with Faculty member set to the new faculty member. |
| ER-5 | 6 | The screen says "Saved." and the Faculty column reads "Test Mentor" again. |

"Remove from the roster" is disabled. |
| ER-2 | 5 | "Remove from the roster" is still disabled: a reason needs three characters or more. |
| ER-3 | 6 | The dialog closes, the screen says "<name> is off every screen and cannot sign in. Every record is kept; Restore brings them back." and the student leaves the roster. |
| ER-4 | 7 | The student is listed, with Status "Removed". |
| ER-5 | 8 | The edit dialog offers "Restore to the roster" in place of "Remove or delete…", and Save is disabled. |
| ER-6 | 9 | The dialog closes, the screen says "<name> is back on the screens with every record. They can sign in again." and the student leaves the Removed list. |

### Post-conditions

The new student is back on the roster, with no batch and no faculty member.
The automated test removes them again when the case ends.

| ER-2 | 4 | "Disable account" is still disabled: a reason needs three characters or more. |
| ER-3 | 5 | The dialog closes, and the screen says "<address> can no longer sign in, and every device it held has been signed out. Nothing they wrote has been removed." Status reads "Disabled" with today's date, and the side panel says "Disabled on <date> — E2E: on sabbatical for a term". |
| ER-4 | 6 | The sign-in is refused: the sign-in page shows an error and stays on `/login`. (What the error says is TC-523.) |
| ER-5 | 7 | The faculty member is listed as Disabled. |
| ER-6 | 8 | The screen says "<address> can sign in again. Capability grants were not restored - grant what is still needed in Governance." and the faculty member leaves the Disabled list. |
| ER-7 | 9 | Their Status reads "Active" again. |

### Post-conditions

The account is active again. The audit trail has a `user` event with the

## TC-522 — The disable dialog says what happens to the faculty member's mentees

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-522 |
| Module | Admin: faculty, disable |
| Priority | P2 |
| Type | Functional, negative (known defect) |
| Automated test | `tests/06-admin-people.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-522` |

### Pre-conditions

1. The common pre-conditions at the top of this file.
2. A new faculty member exists and mentors Test Student: assign them on
   `/admin/mentors` (or with TC-511's steps 1 to 4), so their row reads
   "Mentor · 1".

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Reason | `E2E: checking the mentee sentence` |

### Steps

1. Open `/admin/faculty`.
2. Click their row and click "Disable account".
3. Type `E2E: checking the mentee sentence` into "Reason" and click "Disable account" in the dialog.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 2 | The dialog tells the truth about the mentee: it does not say they stay filed under this faculty member, and it does not say the mentor group is NOT released. |
| ER-2 | 3 | The screen says, among the rest, "1 student(s) were released back to the unassigned pool and need a new faculty member." |

### Known defect

Today the dialog says "Their 1 mentee is still filed under them on Mentors &
Students, and stay there until the office reassigns them." and "The functions
granted to this account are NOT revoked and its mentor group is NOT released
…", and then disabling releases the mentee, as ER-2 shows. The server has
released a disabled faculty member's mentees since B9.1; the dialog's
sentences were not updated.

### Post-conditions

Test Student has no faculty member. Put them back with Test Mentor on
`/admin/mentors` (the automated test does this through the API), and remove
or enable the new faculty member.

   is run signed out, in a private window.
2. An activated faculty member exists, you know their password, and the Main
   Admin has disabled the account (TC-521, steps 1 to 5).

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Portal | Faculty |
| Email and password | The disabled faculty member's |

### Steps

1. Open `/login`.
2. Under "Choose your portal", select Faculty.
3. Enter the faculty member's address and password.
4. Click Sign in.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 4 | The page says "This account has been disabled. Contact the placement office.", which is what the server answers. |

### Known defect

Today the page says "Password sign-in is switched off on this server, so this
form cannot work. Use Continue with Google." The sign-in page gives that one
sentence for every refusal with the status 403, and throws away the server's
own reason. A disabled faculty member is sent to Google sign-in, which refuses
a disabled account too.

### Post-conditions

The faculty member is still disabled. Enable or remove them in the console.

| ER-2 | 4 | The screen says "Every device holding <address> has been signed out." Their Status stays "Active". |
| ER-3 | 5 | The second browser is sent to the sign-in page, `/login?next=%2Fmentor%2Fnotebook…`. |

### Post-conditions

The faculty member can sign in again as usual.

"Remove from the roster" is disabled until a reason of three characters or more is typed. |
| ER-2 | 4 | The dialog closes, the screen says "<name> is off every screen and cannot sign in. Every record is kept; Restore brings them back." and the faculty member leaves the list. |
| ER-3 | 5 | The faculty member is listed, with Status "Removed" and today's date. |
| ER-4 | 6 | The screen says "<name> is back on the screens with every record. They can sign in again." (followed by a sentence about released students). |

| ER-2 | 4 | "Delete for good" is enabled. |
| ER-3 | 5 | The dialog says "That code is not right, has expired, or was already used. Ask for a new one - it is emailed to the office account's own address." and the account is still there. |

| ER-2 | 4 | The screen says "Test Student released from Test Mentor". Test Student is under "Unassigned students", and Test Mentor holds one student fewer: "N − 1/20" ("0/20" on a freshly seeded database). |
| ER-3 | 5 | The button reads "Assign 1 selected to Test Mentor" and is disabled until a reason is typed. |
| ER-4 | 6 | The screen says "1 student assigned to Test Mentor". Test Student is back under "Current mentees", and Test Mentor reads "N/20" again ("1/20" on a freshly seeded database). |
| ER-5 | 7 | "Assignment history · Test Student" lists, newest first, a "Current" spell with Test Mentor, "Assigned by Main Admin (seed) — “E2E: back with their mentor”", then an "Ended" spell with Test Mentor, "Released to the unassigned pool by Main Admin (seed) — “E2E: moving between groups”". |

### Post-conditions

Test Student is with Test Mentor again. The release gave Test Mentor a 90-day
read-only "Mentee log" grant for this student, listed on `/admin/governance`.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 1 | In the "Grant a function" panel, "Give access" is disabled and the panel says "Add at least one person". |
| ER-2 | 2 | The faculty member is added as a chip. |
| ER-3 | 3 | The help line says "Programme-wide: no mentor group narrows it." |
| ER-4 | 4 | The panel says "Narrowed to department Department of Management Studies. 1 faculty member would reach Analytics for N student(s) today." (1 student on a freshly seeded database). |
| ER-5 | 5 | "Give access" is disabled and the panel says "A reason of at least 20 characters is required". |
| ER-6 | 6 | "Give access" is enabled. |
| ER-7 | 7 | The screen says "Granted to 1 subject." The grant is listed: the faculty member, marked "Faculty"; Access "Analytics"; Scope "Programme-wide"; Reach "Department · Department of Management Studies"; Granted by "Main Admin (seed)"; an expiry date; Status "Live". |
| ER-8 | 8 | The grant works at once: "Charts & numbers" opens for the faculty member. |
| ER-9 | 9 | An "Extend 1 grant" box opens above the tabs. |
| ER-10 | 10 | The screen says "Extended “Analytics” for <name>." and the grant's Status reads "Due for review". |
| ER-11 | 11 | Under "Running out within 30 days" the grant is listed as "Due for review". |
| ER-12 | 12 | A "Remove access" box opens, naming the grant and the faculty member. |

| ER-14 | 14 | "Charts & numbers" is closed to them again: they land on `/mentor/notebook`. |

### Post-conditions

The faculty member holds no grant. The audit trail has `capability_grant`
events with the actions `GRANTED`, `EXTENDED` and `REVOKED`, each carrying its
reason.

## TC-531 — A grant's expiry reads back as the day that was typed

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-531 |
| Module | Admin: who can do what |
| Priority | P2 |
| Type | Functional, negative (known defect) |
| Automated test | `tests/06-admin-people.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-531` |

### Pre-conditions

1. The common pre-conditions at the top of this file.
2. The computer's time zone is India Standard Time (UTC+5:30), as the
   college's is. The automated test sets its browser to `Asia/Kolkata`.
3. A new faculty member exists, with no grants.

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Function | Analytics |
| Expires | 45 days from today |
| Reason | `E2E: checking the expiry date` |

### Steps

1. Open `/admin/governance`.
2. Under "Person", choose the new faculty member and click Add.
3. Under "Access", choose "Analytics".
4. Set "Expires" to a date 45 days ahead.
5. Type `E2E: checking the expiry date` into "Reason" and click "Give access".

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 5 | The grant is made, and its Expires column shows the day that was typed. |

### Known defect

Today Expires shows the day after. The form sends the typed day as
23:59:59 UTC, which in India is 05:29 the next morning, and the list prints
that instant in the local calendar. The grant also lasts five and a half hours
into that next day. Extending a grant has the same fault for both of its
dates. The student feature switches screen was fixed for the same fault; this
screen was not.

### Post-conditions

The faculty member holds a live Analytics grant. Remove it on the Grants tab
("Remove access", with a reason of at least 20 characters); the automated test
does this through the API.

## TC-532 — Switching a student feature off for a batch and removing the rule

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-532 |
| Module | Admin: student feature switches |

2. Leaderboards has no rule: it is on for every student, as seeded.
3. Below, N is the number of students seated in the batch, counted the way
   this screen counts them: every student in it, including students removed
   from the roster (their records are kept). "N students" reads "1 student" on
   a freshly seeded database, where Test Student is the batch's only student;
   earlier test runs add more.

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Feature | Leaderboards (`student.leaderboards`) |
| Batch | Master of Business Administration - Finance · 2024-26 Section B |
| Too short a reason | `E2E: short` |

1. Open `/admin/governance/features`.
2. Click "Leaderboards" in the table.
3. Under "Scope", choose "Batch".
4. Under "Applies to", choose "Master of Business Administration - Finance · 2024-26 Section B".

6. Replace the reason with `E2E: leaderboards paused during the audit`, type `Leaderboards are paused this week.` into "Student-facing message" and click Save.
7. Click "Remove override" on the rule.
8. Click "Remove override" in the confirmation.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 2 | The panel is headed "Override · Leaderboards" and says "The API checks this switch before it serves the feature." and "No rule on this feature — it is on for every student." Save is disabled, with "Pick who this applies to." |
| ER-2 | 4 | The panel counts the reach: "N students · beaten only by a student-level rule". |
| ER-3 | 5 | Save is disabled, with "A reason of at least 20 characters is required." |
| ER-4 | 6 | The screen says "Leaderboards is off for 2024-26 Section B — N students." The table's Leaderboards row reads Applies to "Batch · 2024-26 Section B · N students" and Value "Off". The panel shows "1 rule in force": "Batch · 2024-26 Section B", the reason, and "Students are shown: “Leaderboards are paused this week.”" |
| ER-5 | 7 | The panel asks "Remove this rule? The next rung up decides again for N students." |
| ER-6 | 8 | The screen says "Rule removed for 2024-26 Section B. The next rung up decides again for N students." Leaderboards reads "On everywhere" again, and the panel says "No rule on this feature — it is on for every student." |

### Post-conditions

Leaderboards is on for every student again. The audit trail has
`feature_override` events for the rule being set and cleared.

| Automated test | `tests/06-admin-people.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-533` |

### Pre-conditions

1. The common pre-conditions at the top of this file.

### Test data

None.

### Steps

1. Open `/admin/governance/features`.
2. Under "Enforcement", choose "Not wired yet".

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 1 | The screen says "All 10 switches are enforced by the API." The table lists Voice interviewer (Mock Interview), REEP Agent (chat), Resume Builder, English baseline test, Jobs feed & applications, Leaderboards, Document uploads, Time allocation ledger, Skilling & badges and Mentor meeting log, each "Server-enforced". |
| ER-2 | 2 | The table says "No switch matches these filters." No switch is unwired, so none of them shows "This switch is not wired yet, so it cannot be set." and the server's refusal of a rule on an unwired switch cannot be reached from this screen in this build. |

## TC-534 — A student refused a switched-off feature reads the office's message

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ID | TC-534 |
| Module | Admin: student feature switches; the student's Leaderboards |
| Priority | P2 |
| Type | Functional, positive (known defect) |
| Automated test | `tests/06-admin-people.spec.ts`, title tagged `@TC-534` |

### Pre-conditions

1. The common pre-conditions at the top of this file.
2. Leaderboards has no rule, as seeded.
3. A second browser, or a private window, for the student.

### Test data

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Batch | Master of Business Administration - Finance · 2024-26 Section B |
| Student-facing message | `Leaderboards are paused this week.` |
| Student | `student@bgscet.ac.in` / `student123` |

### Steps

1. As the Main Admin, switch "Leaderboards" off for the batch "Master of Business Administration - Finance · 2024-26 Section B", with a student-facing message.
2. Sign in as the student and open `/student/leaderboards`.

Step 1 is TC-532's steps 1 to 6, with the message from the test data.

### Expected results

| # | After step | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| ER-1 | 2 | The Leaderboards screen shows the office's message, "Leaderboards are paused this week." |

### Known defect

Today the screen says "Could not load the leaderboard." The server refuses
with the office's message (a 403 whose detail is the student-facing message),
but the student screens throw the detail away on their first read. Jobs and
Uploads do the same ("Could not load the jobs board.", "Could not load your
uploads."). The feature switches screen promises the message is "What the
student reads when this rule refuses them."

### Post-conditions

Remove the rule again (TC-532, steps 7 and 8); the automated test does this
through the API.
