# 05 — Incident Reports

| | |
|---|---|
| Standard followed | ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-3:2021 §11 *Test Incident Report* (IEEE 829's "anomaly report") |
| Cycle | 2026-09-29, build `main@1685e67` |
| Severity scale | **Critical**: data loss or a security breach · **Major**: a feature unusable, no workaround · **Medium**: wrong behaviour with a workaround, or a 500 reachable from a normal client · **Low**: cosmetic, a documentation or contract mismatch |
| Priority scale | P1 fix now · P2 next release · P3 when convenient |

Incidents are in four groups. **DEF** is a product defect. **OBS** is an
observation that is not a defect but that a reader of the numbers needs.
**TW** is a defect in the testware or test environment. Each TW is recorded
because it produced misleading results before it was caught, which is the
lesson worth keeping.

## Product defects

### DEF-001: The whole "Email delivery" screen answers 422 to everyone · Major · P1 · **FIXED on this branch**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Found by | API-02-owner `/api/admin/mail-log` (Swagger contract suite), and API-02-anon on the same path (anonymous got 422, not 401) |
| Endpoints | `GET /api/admin/mail-log`, `GET /api/admin/mail-log/suppression`, `DELETE /api/admin/mail-log/suppression` |
| Steps | Sign in as the Main Admin → `GET /api/admin/mail-log` |
| Expected | 200 with the log (the office's only view of `mail_logs`) |
| Actual | `422 {"detail":[{"loc":["body"],"msg":"Field required"}]}` for the admin, a mentor, a student and an anonymous caller alike |
| Root cause | `routers/admin_mail.py` passed `require_admin`, a plain function `require_admin(session: dict)`, straight to `Depends(...)`. FastAPI reads its un-annotated `session: dict` parameter as a **required JSON request body**. Validation fails before any authentication runs. A browser `fetch` GET sends no body, so `/admin/mail` could never load a row. No test called these endpoints. |
| Impact | The feature AGENTS.md describes as the answer to "the code never came" (the mail log plus the SES suppression lookup and lift) has been unusable since it shipped |
| Fix | A `_office` dependency (`Depends(get_current_session)` → `require_admin`) used by all three endpoints |
| Confirmation | The live API returns 422 before the fix and 200 after it (`mail-log after fix: 200`). The new `apps/api-py/tests/test_admin_mail_log.py` **fails on the old code and passes on the fix**. The codebase guards (`test_codebase_guards.py`, `test_capability_enforcement.py`) are still green |

### DEF-002: `PUT /api/student/profile` answers 500 when a boolean is sent as `null` · Medium · P2

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Found by | Schemathesis (run 1) |
| Reproduce | `PUT /api/student/profile` as a student, body `{"interested_in_jobs": null}` (also `interested_in_internships`, `leaderboard_opt_out`) |
| Expected | 422 (or the field ignored) |
| Actual | 500. `IntegrityError: NotNullViolation: null value in column "interested_in_jobs" of relation "student_profiles"`. There were 120 occurrences in one run |
| Root cause | The Pydantic input model declares these fields `bool \| None` and the handler copies `None` onto NOT NULL columns |
| Suggested fix | Skip `None` for the NOT NULL booleans (as `exclude_none` would), or type them `bool` with a default |

### DEF-003: `POST /api/student/checkin` answers 500 for an unknown course code · Medium · P2

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Reproduce | As a student: `{"course_code": "", "module": ""}` |
| Actual | 500. `ForeignKeyViolation ... "lab_sessions_course_code_fkey"` (14 occurrences) |
| Expected | 404 or 422 naming the course |
| Suggested fix | Look the course up first and refuse it in words |

### DEF-004: `POST /api/admin/jobs` and `POST /api/admin/criteria` answer 500 for an empty or unknown `course_id` · Medium · P2

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Reproduce | As the Main Admin: `POST /api/admin/jobs` with `"course_id": ""` (the same for `/api/admin/criteria`) |
| Actual | 500. `ForeignKeyViolation "fk_jobs_course"` / `"fk_placement_criteria_course"` |
| Expected | 422, like the handler's other checks (for example, the `apply_url` check) |
| Note | An empty string is exactly what an HTML `<select>` with a blank option posts, so a real client can reach this |
| Suggested fix | Treat `""` as `None`, and resolve the id through the existing spine resolver before insert |

### DEF-005: `PATCH /api/admin/swoc/entries/{id}` answers 500 for an unknown `linked_*_id` · Medium · P2

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Reproduce | As the Main Admin: `{"linked_job_id": ""}` (or `linked_skill_id` / `linked_session_id`) |
| Actual | 500. `ForeignKeyViolation "fk_swoc_linked_job"` (and the same for skill and session) |
| Expected | 422 |

### DEF-006: GET list endpoints answer 500 for out-of-range integers in the query string · Medium · P2

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Found by | Schemathesis run 2 (**GET only**, so reachable by a read-only admin screen or a crafted URL) |
| Reproduce | `GET /api/admin/audit?page=92917030724915670548480` · `GET /api/admin/swoc?semester=-954555328274038435872768&page=3214` · `GET /api/admin/placement?year=-5466912982786` |
| Actual | 500. `DataError: NumericValueOutOfRange: integer out of range` / `bigint out of range` |
| Expected | 422 from the query schema |
| Suggested fix | Bound the `Query(...)` parameters (`ge=1, le=…`) as `/admin/mail-log`'s `limit` already is |

### DEF-007: Text containing a NUL byte or an invalid `\u` escape answers 500 · Low · P3

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Endpoints seen | `POST /api/admin/catalogue/copy`, `POST /api/admin/catalogue/subjects/import` |
| Actual | 500. `DataError: PostgreSQL text fields cannot contain NUL (0x00) bytes`, and `UntranslatableCharacter: unsupported Unicode escape sequence` |
| Expected | 422 |
| Suggested fix | One shared validator that rejects `\x00` in free text, applied in the input models or the import parser |

### DEF-008: Many 422 responses break the documented error schema · Low · P3

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Found by | Schemathesis `response_schema_conformance`: 41 violations in run 1 and 6 in run 2 |
| Example | `GET /api/student/leaderboards?board=__main__` → `422 {"detail": "Unknown board. One of: …"}`, while the document declares 422 as `HTTPValidationError` whose `detail` is an **array** |
| Impact | A client generated from the Swagger document (or the SPA's `detailOf` helper) must handle two shapes. The SPA already does, which is why this is Low |
| Suggested fix | Either raise these as 400 (a business-rule refusal, not schema validation), or declare `responses={422: {"model": ErrorOut}}` on those routes |

### DEF-009: With the API unreachable, the login screen says "This server signs in with Google only" · Low · P3

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Found by | NFR-REL-01 (Playwright, `page.route('**/api/**', abort)`). Kept as the **known failure** NFR-REL-01b (`test.fail`, per the repository's convention) |
| Steps | Make `/api` unreachable (a network drop, an API restart, a deploy) → open `/login` |
| Expected | The sign-in screen renders, **and** says the server could not be reached (or says nothing about which doors exist) |
| Actual | The screen renders, but the password form is hidden and the copy reads *"This server signs in with Google only. A REEP password, when one is issued to you, comes from the placement cell."* (screenshot: `results/playwright-nfr/…/test-failed-1.png`, first run) |
| Root cause | `LoginComponent.probe()` fails **closed** for the password form when `/api/auth/sso/status` cannot be fetched. That is deliberate, and it is right. But the template's `@else` branch uses the copy for "the server told us passwords are off", so "we could not ask" is printed as a fact about the server. That is the `X-Reep-Scope` rule in AGENTS.md ("we asked and it is fine" and "we could not ask" are opposite facts) applied to the login screen |
| Impact | During an outage or a deploy, a student with a password is told they do not have one and is sent to the placement cell |
| Suggested fix | A third state for the probe, `unknown`, with its own sentence ("We could not reach REEP just now — try again in a minute") |

### DEF-010: Text below the WCAG 2.2 AA contrast ratio on the login and student screens · Medium · P2

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Found by | NFR-A11Y-01 (axe-core 4.13, rule `color-contrast`, impact **serious**). No *critical* violation anywhere, so the gate passed. `/register` had none at all |
| Where (element · foreground/background · ratio, need ≥ 4.5:1) | `/login` `.google__sub`, `.or > span`, `.field__help` · `#a596b3` on `#ffffff` · **2.75** · `/student`, `/student/jobs`, `/student/time-log` sidebar `.sec-label` · `#7c7891` on `#ece4f5` · **3.42** · `/student` `.swoc-empty` · `#8a8894` on `#fff` · **3.48** · `/student` header `.chip.good` · `#137a4a` on `#ece4f5` · **4.34** |
| Impact | Low-vision users (WCAG 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum), Level AA). The sidebar labels appear on every student screen |
| Suggested fix | Darken the muted-ink tokens in `reep-v2.scss` (for example, `#a596b3` → about `#76688a` reaches 4.5:1 on white) and re-run `testing/playwright/accessibility.nfr.ts` |

## Observations (not defects)

| ID | Observation | Evidence | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|---|
| OBS-001 | With 2 API workers, a session retired by a newer sign-in keeps working on the **other** worker for up to `AUTH_REVOCATION_CACHE_SECONDS` (60 s) | API-03-007 measured **60.4 s** | This is by design (a per-process cache that saves one query per request). But "one device at a time" is only eventually consistent, within 60 s. The test asserts the window, not immediacy |
| OBS-002 | Sign-in is the one CPU-heavy request: scrypt (N=16384) per login | Login mean 51 ms at 50 VUs; **1,884 ms mean at a 100-user spike** (all other endpoints stayed at a 73 ms median) | On a results-day spike, logins queue behind each other on the workers' CPU. That argues for autoscaling on CPU and for keeping sessions long, not for a weaker hash |
| OBS-003 | FastAPI does not add 401 or 403 to the OpenAPI document | Schemathesis "Undocumented HTTP status code" (≈250 per admin run), almost all 401 or 403 | The contract is incomplete, not wrong. A global `responses={401: …, 403: …}` would make it complete |
| OBS-004 | Sign-in happily accepts a 5,000-character email and password (401, no 422) | API-03-005 | Harmless (the password is not hashed before lookup fails), but a length bound would be cheap defence in depth |

## Testware and environment incidents

| ID | What happened | Effect before it was caught | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| TW-001 | The JMeter plan fed accounts from a CSV Data Set. JMeter hands out a **new line on every iteration**, so later virtual users signed in as accounts earlier ones were still using, and REEP's one-session rule retired them | The first stress run reported **44.9 % errors** (all 401). That was a scripting fault, not a capacity result | Virtual user N signs in as `loadtestNNN` (a JSR223 pre-processor, deterministic). All scenarios were re-run on a freshly restarted API: **0 HTTP errors** |
| TW-002 | The API suite ran during the first load run and signed in as two of JMeter's accounts | 810 401s in that load run | Disjoint account pools: 101–110 are reserved and never in the CSV. The load run was repeated |
| TW-003 | Schemathesis 4.28 filter semantics: include filters of different kinds are OR'ed and exclude filters are **AND'ed**, and `--exclude-method-regex` is case-sensitive against lower-case method names | Two runs meant to be GET-only also fuzzed POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE against the **local dev database** (≈5,700 writes). That is how DEF-002..005 and 007 were found | One case-insensitive method exclude, path exclusions moved into a lookahead on the include, no stateful phase. Verified by the API log: **0 writes** besides the two logins. The dev database was dropped and rebuilt before any later suite ran. It was never a shared or production database |
| TW-004 | Selenium: one of 100 journeys hit `StaleElementReferenceException` (Angular re-rendered the login form between find and type) | 99/100 | `LoginPage.sign_in` re-finds and retries on a stale element |
| TW-005 | `apps/api-py/.env` copied verbatim from `.env.example` has inline `# comments` after bare values, and pydantic-settings reads them as the value (for example, an AWS region of `# falls back to …`) | 41 backend tests failed on the first run, all in mail sending | Use only the quoted `KEY="value"` lines (or no `.env` at all, as CI does). Worth a follow-up in `.env.example` |
| TW-006 | 100 Chromium instances **alive at the same moment** (`--barrier`) do not fit the 16 GB test bed: 14.9 GB and ≈800 Chrome processes with default flags, and 13.6 GB and 639 processes with `LIGHT_CHROME=1` before the watchdog stopped it | Two all-at-once runs were stopped before the out-of-memory killer reached Postgres. The API and DB were checked healthy after each | 100 instances are run with 100 concurrent threads and a serialised launch (100/100 passed), and **50 truly simultaneous** browsers run with `--barrier` (46/50; the 4 timeouts came from host CPU saturation, load average 128 on 4 vCPU, while the API's own p50 stayed at 10 ms). Genuinely simultaneous 100: `selenium/grid/docker-compose.yml` on a larger host |
| TW-007 | The Selenium runner read the student home's `<h1>` as soon as one was visible. That is the LOADING placeholder, "Landing", so 4/100 journeys "failed" on a heading that was about to become "Welcome back" | 96/100, then 98/100 (a stale read inside the new wait) | `BasePage.student_home_outcome()` waits for the terminal state (data or error), tolerates the `@switch` swapping the node, and counts the error state as a real failure: **100/100** |
