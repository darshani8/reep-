    issues a real `delete_object`, which on a versioned bucket removes the
    recording from every view while keeping the bytes.

    The obligation that comes with it is recorded on the bucket and repeated
    here because it is a product change, not an infra one: the consent panel
    still tells students their recording is destroyed after the policy's
