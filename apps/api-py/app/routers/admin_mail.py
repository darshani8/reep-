"""What REEP has tried to send, and whether the provider will deliver it.

    GET    /api/admin/mail-log                      the last N messages
    GET    /api/admin/mail-log/suppression          is THIS address deliverable?
    DELETE /api/admin/mail-log/suppression          lift it, and say why

WHY THIS EXISTS. `mail_logs` has been written on every send since the Prisma
days and READ BY NOTHING — no endpoint, no screen, no script. The index
`ix_maillog_sent_at` was added for "the ops mail screen", and that screen was
never built. So when a student says "the code never came", the office had no
way to answer even the first question, which is whether REEP tried at all.

THE SECOND QUESTION IS THE ONE THAT COST US A STUDENT. `MailStatus.SENT` means
SES ACCEPTED the message, never that anybody received it. A hard bounce or a
complaint puts an address on SES's ACCOUNT SUPPRESSION LIST, and from then on
SES accepts every send for it and delivers nothing — so a student whose address
bounced once, possibly during the sandbox period months ago, is told "we have
emailed you a code" by the onboarding walk, by "Forgot password?", by the
change-password screen and by the setup-link button, every time, forever, and
not one of those mails can arrive. Google sign-in keeps working, because no
mail is involved. That is exactly the report this module was written for, and
before it there was no place in the product where the truth existed.

`mail_transport.suppression_for` now refuses such a send up front, so new
attempts land as FAILED with the reason in `error` rather than as a lie. This
screen is the other half: it shows those rows, it asks SES about an address on
demand — which also covers the message that was SENT honestly and bounced
AFTERWARDS, where the row cannot know — and it lets the office lift the
suppression once the address is fixed, which is the actual remedy and is
otherwise a trip to the AWS console.

MAIN ADMIN ONLY (`require_admin`), and not a capability. `mail_logs.recipient`
is every address the deployment has ever written to — students, applicants who
were rejected, staff — so this is a roster of people by another name, and rule
2's answer for the whole roster is the office account. A capability would be
the office handing that out; if that is ever wanted, it is a catalogue key and
a B2.1 enforcement row, not a default.

READ-ONLY OVER `mail_logs`. Nothing here writes, edits or deletes a row: the
table is the record of what was attempted and must stay exactly that. The one
write in this module is to the AUDIT trail, for the one act that changes
something outside REEP.
