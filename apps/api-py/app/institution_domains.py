"""Which email domains a college will admit an applicant on.

ONE ANSWER, ONE PLACE. Three call sites fence an address before it becomes an
account — approving a registration (`routers/registration.py` GUARD 1), the
Main Admin editing a student's address (`routers/admin_students.py`), and
creating a faculty account (`routers/admin_faculty.py`, B3.2) — and until now
each of them read `settings.provisionable_email_domains` directly. That was
correct while there was one fence for the whole deployment. It stops being
correct the moment there are two colleges, because the question is no longer
"is this address one of ours" but "is this address one of THEIRS", and three
call sites each reading a global is three places to forget that.

THE ENVIRONMENT IS THE FALLBACK, NOT THE FLOOR. A college with no domains
recorded falls back to `settings.provisionable_email_domains`, which is exactly
what every college gets today, so nothing changes for a deployment that never
opens the Colleges screen. A college that HAS a list is fenced by that list
alone — the environment does not widen it, because a per-tenant fence that the
deployment's own settings can quietly reopen is not a fence.

Read `Settings.provisionable_email_domains` for why this fence exists on
provisioning and deliberately not on sign-in: the two run in opposite
directions, and a domain test on sign-in can only lock out somebody already
enrolled.
