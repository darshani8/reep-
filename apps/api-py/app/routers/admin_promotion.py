"""Moving a whole batch through the programme — B4.3 and B4.4.

    POST /admin/cohorts/{id}/promote?dry_run=       everybody up one semester

    GET  /admin/cohorts/{id}/promotion-history      what has been done to it

ITS OWN MODULE, mounted under the same `/admin` prefix as `admin_students.py`
and `admin_faculty.py`, because those two are the house precedent and the two
files that would otherwise have grown are ~1700 lines each. The client sees one
flat surface; nothing about the URL says which module answered.

WHAT A PROMOTION IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT. It moves exactly one number —
`students.current_semester` — and writes one new row per student in
`student_semester_history`. **Nothing is rewritten.** Four other tables carry a
semester number and every one of them is a fact about a semester that has
already happened or about the curriculum:

    semester_results.semester    under uq_semester_result (student, semester)
    subject_marks                reached only through semester_result_id
    english_baselines.semester   under uq_english_baseline_semester
    courses.semester             the subject's slot in the curriculum

Rewriting any of them would collide on its own unique constraint partway
through a batch, leaving a half-promoted cohort and an IntegrityError on screen
— and even if it did not collide, "Ravi scored 8.1 in semester 3" would silently
become a claim about semester 4. `tests/test_admin_promotion.py` pins every one
of those columns byte-identical across a promotion; that guard is the point of
this module, not a formality.

The one legitimate SIDE EFFECT is that promotion unlocks a new English baseline
attempt, because `POST /student/english-baseline/start` keys on
`students.current_semester`. The old attempt is not touched and still renders;
the dialog says so.

WHAT GRADUATION IS. `students.status = GRADUATED`, `users.role = ALUMNI`,
`token_version + 1` (so the account is signed out of every device on its next
request), a history row, and `cohorts.status = GRADUATED`. It creates NO
`alumni_profiles` row, deliberately — `company` there is NOT NULL and mere ROW
EXISTENCE is what `GET /api/alumni/profile`'s `created:` flag reports, which is
the whole trigger for the first-login create-profile form. A row minted here
would either invent a company or suppress that form for ever. The graduate
meets the form, which is what it is for.

AND THE ROLE FLIP ALONE DOES NOT CLOSE THE STUDENT SCREENS. `_require_student`
in routers/student.py and its twin in routers/student_programme.py read ONLY
`session["studentId"]`, and `_payload_for` mints that claim for anybody with a
`students` row — which a graduate still has, because the row IS their record.
Both helpers now check the ROLE as well; without that, graduation would move an
account to ALUMNI in the console and leave roughly forty student endpoints wide
open to it. `tests/test_admin_promotion.py` proves a graduate is refused.

WHY PROMOTE REFUSES AT THE CEILING AND GRADUATE ONLY WARNS. Promoting a student
past `academic_courses.total_semesters` writes a number that is WRONG — semester
9 of an eight-semester programme is not a decision, it is a corrupt row, and
every screen that prints it prints a falsehood. Graduating a batch a semester
early writes nothing invalid; it is a judgement the office is entitled to make,
about people it knows, and `total_semesters` is a nullable column many
deployments will never fill in. So the ceiling is a refusal and the
final-semester and end-date checks are `warn`.

SCOPE. `admin.students` throughout — no new capability key — plus
`assert_batch_within_reach` from `admin_students.py`, imported and never
restated: a scoped holder who reaches only part of a batch is refused the whole
act rather than promoting the part they can see and reporting a count that does
not match the batch. Rule 2's per-student gate is deliberately NOT called in a
loop here, for the same reason `batch_action` does not call it: the answer has
to be one yes or one no for the batch.

RULE 1 is untouched — nothing in this module goes near a model.
