/**
 * The Jobs sheet's row: what `GET /api/admin/jobs` answers, and what the grid
 * draws from it.
 *
 * THE STATUS COLUMN ANSWERS "IS THIS ON THE STUDENT BOARD", NOT "HAS THE DATE
 * PASSED", and that correction is the reason this file changed with B12.2.
 * `app/jobs_visibility.py::visible_clauses` filters the two candidate feeds on
 * `Job.status == 'open'` ALONE and never looks at `closes_on` — so a posting
 * whose deadline went by last week is still on every student's board, and a
 * sheet that read "Closed" off that date told the office a posting was gone
 * while students were still applying to it. The column therefore leads with
 * `status`: `Withdrawn` when the office has closed it, and otherwise a reading
 * of the deadline in which a date in the past is `Past deadline` — a WARNING
 * that the posting is still listed, not a statement that it is not.
 *
 * WHAT THE BOARD DRAWS THAT NOTHING ANSWERS, and why it is an em dash here
 * rather than a number:
 *
 *   CTC        A posting records no pay. Nothing in 04-backend-changes.md adds
 *              one either — B12.3's "median CTC" is computed from OFFERS, which
 *              is a different record — so this is a gap in the plan, not a task
 *              waiting its turn, and it is reported as one.
 *   Eligible   The board reads "6 / 13": applicants over the students the
 *              posting is open to. The numerator is real; the denominator is a
 *              count of the students the college/course/track filters admit,
 *              which no endpoint answers, so the column shows the count alone.
 *
 * A plausible number in either of those cells is indistinguishable from working
 * software in a screenshot, which is the one thing this phase must not ship.
 *
 * AN ABSENT NARROWING IS THE WIDEST ONE, on both of the fields B12.1 added: a
 * NULL college and an EMPTY track list mean EVERY college and EVERY track —
 * `app/jobs_visibility.py` argues why at length, and it is the reading every
 * posting published before B12.1 depends on. So the cells say "Every college"
 * and "Every track" and never a dash, which would read as "nobody".
