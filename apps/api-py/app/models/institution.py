"""College and Department — the two levels above a Cohort.

WHY THESE EXIST. The student's profile carries a locked card reading College /
Department / Batch / Entry date / Expected completion, "verified by Main Admin".
Four of those five had no data source at all: there was no College column
anywhere in the schema, and Department was free text on `users` that nothing
ever wrote. This module supplies the two missing levels so all five are reached
through one join from `students.cohort_id`.

THE HIERARCHY, IN FULL:

    College -> Department -> Course -> Specialization -> Cohort -> Student

The middle two were deferred once and are now built. Inserting them cost two
tables and two nullable columns on `cohorts`, and — this is the point — **not
one existing student row changed**, because a student stores only `cohort_id`
and reads everything else through it. Denormalising College or Department onto
`students` would have been faster to write and would have made this insertion a
backfill of every student row instead.

WHY THERE IS NO "ACADEMIC YEAR" LEVEL, though one was drawn in the original
sketch. The batch already IS the year: `cohorts.batch_label` says "2024-26",
and `start_date` / `end_date` bound it. `students.current_semester` and
`courses.semester` carry the same fact again from two other angles. A table
would have been the FIFTH representation of one idea, and a fact stored five
ways is a fact that will eventually disagree with itself. If a year ever needs
a record of its OWN — its own admission open/close dates, courses that run only
in certain years — it inserts then at exactly the cost it would have today,
which is the whole property this shape was built for.

THEY ARE OPTIONAL, AND WHETHER THEY STAY OPTIONAL IS ONE LINE. See
HIERARCHY_LEVELS below. The columns are nullable permanently; requiredness is a
rule about what THIS RELEASE accepts, not a promise about rows already written.

WHY "AcademicCourse" AND NOT "Course". `Course` is already a model — the
22MBA11 curriculum in app/models/course.py, which is what a student ENROLS in
and earns marks for. This level is a different thing: a programme in the
admissions catalogue (MBA, MCA) that a batch belongs to and under which many of
those courses are taught. One name meaning two things is a bug waiting for
whoever assumes it means one, and this repo has a guard test for exactly that.
`CourseOut` (student.py) and `SpecializationOut` (voice_platform/api/admin.py)
are likewise taken, and `Specialization` is booked THREE times already — the
interview matrix's four tracks, `PlatformSpecialization`, and
`interview_sessions.specialization`. Hence the prefix in code. **The UI still
says "Course" and "Specialization"**, which is the Batch/Cohort precedent
applied twice more: the internal name is for correctness, the external one is
for the person filling the form.

BATCH vs COHORT. The interface says "Batch"; this schema says `Cohort`, because
`cohorts` already existed (migration fea4515cdba5) and `students.cohort_id`
already pointed at it. The mapping is deliberate and is documented once in
docs/institutional-spine-build-log.md rather than being discovered from a
confusing diff.

STATUS IS A PLAIN STRING, NOT A PG ENUM. The same reasoning app/models/
voice_platform.py sets out for `degree_level`: a new status value should be a
data change, not a `CREATE TYPE` migration carrying all three of AGENTS.md's
enum gotchas. Archive and restore are therefore an UPDATE, never a DELETE —
which is also what the design's admin console does.

#: between the console, the student's locked card and a future export.
#:
#: TO MAKE A LEVEL MANDATORY: change its `required=False` to `required=True` on
#: the line below, and deploy. THAT IS THE WHOLE CHANGE. No migration, no schema
#: change, no second edit anywhere.
#:
#: THE COLUMNS STAY NULLABLE FOREVER, AND THAT IS NOT AN OVERSIGHT. Nullability
#: is what the DATABASE promises about rows that ALREADY EXIST; `required` is
#: what THIS RELEASE asks of a NEW one. They are different questions, and
#: conflating them turns "make it mandatory" back into a migration — one that
#: aborts on the first legacy batch, halfway through a deploy.
#:
#: WHAT THE FLIP DOES NOT DO is make existing batches compliant. Nothing can:
#: the morning after, every batch created while the level was optional is
#: missing it. So three things ship WITH the switch, not after it —
#: `GET /api/admin/cohorts/incomplete` lists exactly those rows,
#: `AdminCohortOut.missing_levels` flags them, and PATCH still accepts any edit
#: that does not make the gap WORSE. Without those, the morning after the flip
#: the console starts refusing saves on rows nobody can fix, and the fix will be
#: to flip it back.
#:
#: ORDER IS DEPTH, and a required level implies the shallower ones, because
#: ancestors are DERIVED rather than typed (see _resolve_ancestry in
#: app/routers/admin.py). A gap in the middle is incoherent, and
#: test_codebase_guards.py pins that the required levels form a prefix.
