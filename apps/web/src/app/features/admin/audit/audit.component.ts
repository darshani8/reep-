/**
 * Audit log — AuditLog.html, now reading the trail it always described.
 *
 * The approved board is `docs/redesign-2026-09/design/admin/AuditLog.html` and
 * the brief is `02-admin-console-spec.md` §21. Phase 2 drew this whole screen
 * over no rows, because `architecture_events.record_change` had been writing
 * `redesign_audit_events` for months and nothing in `apps/api-py/app/routers/`
 * could read a row back. `B2.7` landed that reader — `app/routers/audit.py` —
 * and this file is the screen wired onto it. What follows is what changed and,
 * more importantly, what deliberately did not.
 *
 * THREE ENDPOINTS, AND ALL THREE ARE READS.
 *
 *   GET /api/admin/audit              the filtered page: `items`, `page`,
 *                                     `page_size` and `total` — `total` being
 *                                     the WHOLE filtered set, which is what
 *                                     draws "1-50 of 412" and decides whether
 *                                     Next is live.
 *   GET /api/admin/audit/{id}         one event plus its `before` / `after` /
 *                                     `metadata`. The panel.
 *   GET /api/admin/audit/export.csv   the same filters as a file.
 *
 * There is no write endpoint on that router and there must never be one: an
 * audit trail a console can edit is not an audit trail. Nothing on this screen
 * posts anything.
 *
 * THE PAGING IS THE SERVER'S, SO AG GRID'S IS OFF. `[pagination]` is `false`
 * and the status bar carries the pager. The grid holds exactly the rows of one
 * server page; letting AG Grid paginate on top of that would slice fifty rows
 * into two client pages and label them "1 of 2" beside a server count of 412.
 *
 * THE ACTION AND TARGET LISTS ARE NOT INVENTED. `KNOWN_ACTIONS` and
 * `KNOWN_TARGET_TYPES` below are read out of the `record_change` call sites
 * themselves (enumerated against each one, and each entry says which module
 * writes it); anything else the loaded page actually contains is unioned in on
 * top. An option nobody ever wrote is a filter that always returns nothing,
 * and on this screen "no results" is read as "it did not happen".
 *
 * ONE ACTION VOCABULARY IS UNREACHABLE AND THAT IS A BACKEND DEFECT, NOT A
 * CHOICE HERE. `_filters` in `routers/audit.py` compares
 * `AuditEvent.action == action.strip().upper()`, but `routers/redesign.py`
 * writes its mentor-notebook actions in lower case (`created`, `updated`,
 * `published`, `archived`, `registered`). Upper-casing `created` yields
 * `CREATED`, which matches `interview_question` rows and never matches a
 * notebook row. Those five are therefore NOT offered in the Action select —
 * offering them would be the dead filter this screen must not have — and they
 * are listed in `UNFILTERABLE_LOWERCASE_ACTIONS` so the next reader finds the
 * reason rather than the omission. The rows themselves still list and still
 * open; only the Action filter cannot reach them.
 *
 * THE COLLEGE FILTER STAYS DISABLED, AND IT IS NOT WAITING ON THIS PHASE.
 * See `AUDIT_COLLEGE_SCOPE_PHASE`.
 *
 * THE GRID'S FIFTH COLUMN IS "Route", NOT THE BOARD'S "Summary". The endpoint
 * returns `route`, `request_id` and `correlation_id`; it returns no summary
 * sentence and there is nothing to compose one from without opening the event.
 * A column headed "Summary" filled with a URL path is a mislabel, and this is
 * the one screen where a heading that does not describe its cells is expensive.
