"""Faculty belong to a department, and through it a college.

THE GAP THIS CLOSES. A student's institution has always been reachable: one
pointer (`students.cohort_id`), and college / department / course / batch read
through the join. Staff had no pointer at all. The only institutional field on a
staff row was `users.department` — FREE TEXT typed into a form — so "Dept of
Management Studies", "DMS" and "Management" were three departments to anything
trying to group by one, and no staff row could name its college at all. With
more than one college in `colleges`, that is the difference between being able
to say which institution a person belongs to and not.

What is pinned here:

  * a faculty member can be filed on creation and afterwards, and the college
    comes back through the join rather than being copied onto the row;
  * an unknown department is REFUSED, because a write that reports success and
    stores null is the failure this whole change exists to remove;
  * `filed` is the flag a screen branches on — a falsy department name cannot
    tell "nobody filed this person" from "a department with a blank name";
  * the free-text line and the pointer never disagree, because the leave form
    prints the one and the console groups by the other;
  * only the Main Admin may file anyone, and only a FACULTY row can be reached.
