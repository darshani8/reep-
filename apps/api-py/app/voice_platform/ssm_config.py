"""Load the platform's PLATFORM_* settings from SSM Parameter Store at boot.

WHY. The api's task definition — and so its environment — is owned by the
Terraform stack in infra/aws. The voice platform's resources are created by the
CDK stack in infra/cdk, which knows the queue URLs, bucket names, table names
and the OpenSearch endpoint only once it has deployed them. Putting those into
the task definition would mean a `terraform apply` for every platform change,
which is exactly the two-tools-for-one-door problem AGENTS.md warns about. So
the CDK stack publishes them as SSM parameters under
`/<project>/voice-platform/PLATFORM_*`, grants the task role permission to read
that path, and the api reads them here at startup. CDK alone then owns the
platform end to end; Terraform is not involved.

RULES OF THE LOAD. Environment wins: a PLATFORM_* variable that is already set
is never overwritten, so a laptop `.env` or an explicit task-definition value
stays authoritative. Only blank settings are filled. Anything that goes wrong —
no credentials, no permission, no such path, a network timeout — is logged at
INFO and leaves every setting exactly as it was; the platform then runs with
its honest no-op fallbacks and GET /api/platform/admin/status says so. Boot is
never blocked: the client is built with a two-second connect timeout and a
single attempt.

ONLY ON AWS. `should_attempt()` is true when ENV is a production name or when
PLATFORM_SSM_PREFIX is set explicitly. Development and CI never call AWS.
