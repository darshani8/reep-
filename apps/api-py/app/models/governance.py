"""Governance — who may reach which screen, and which screens a student has.

TWO INSTRUMENTS, AND THEY HAVE OPPOSITE DEFAULTS. Collapsing them into one
setting is the bug this file exists to prevent, because the same control would
then sometimes grant and sometimes remove.

  * `CapabilityGrant` is DENY BY DEFAULT. Nobody holds a capability until an
    admin issues it, to a named user or to an `AccessGroup` whose members
    inherit it.
  * `FeatureOverride` is ALLOW BY DEFAULT. Every student has every feature until
    one is switched off, at any rung of the institutional hierarchy — a whole
    specialization, one batch, or a single student.

HOW A CAPABILITY COMPOSES WITH RULE 2 — the only question that matters here,
and the two answer DIFFERENT questions, which is what makes the composition safe:

    rule 2      decides WHICH STUDENTS a staff member may reach.
    capability  decides WHICH SCREENS AND ACTIONS they may use.

They are orthogonal, and both must pass. A grant may therefore widen the second —
that is what granting Analytics to a mentor does — but it can NEVER widen the
first. Holding `student.interviews` lets a mentor open scorecards for students
ALREADY IN THEIR OWN GROUP; it cannot reach a student outside it, and a MENTOR
WITH NO GROUP STILL SEES NOBODY, whatever they hold.

That is the whole safety argument: rule 2 exists because "no filter" is the
reading that turns an empty mentor group into the whole programme, and a
capability that could relax the student filter would hand that reading back
through a different door. `tests/test_governance.py` pins it.

CAPABILITIES ARE ADDITIVE OVER A ROLE BASELINE, not deny-everything. Every role
already holds the screens it has today (app/governance.py's ROLE_BASELINE), so
introducing this table takes nothing away from anyone; a grant is how a person
gets something their role does not already carry. A deny-by-default rollout would
have silently removed every mentor's own mentee log on deploy.

THE EXCEPTION, MARKED EVERYWHERE. Analytics, exports and the institution
hierarchy are cross-cohort by nature — there is no group to narrow them to. A
`PROGRAMME` capability therefore hands over the whole college, which is why it
is a separate scope on the catalogue rather than a footnote, why the console
paints it red, and why every grant on this table demands a reason.

THE CATALOGUE IS CODE, ONLY STATE IS ROWS — the same rule as the 48 badges
(models/badge.py) and the programme milestones (models/milestone.py). Adding a
capability is a code change on purpose: each one has to be enforced at a call
site, and a row that names a capability nothing checks is a promise the API does
not keep. What admins maintain in the database is who holds what.

`reason` is NOT NULL on both tables. An audit trail whose entries do not say why
is a list of dates.
