"""registrations.personal_email / linkedin_url — the two boxes the public form
asked for and threw away.

Revision ID: a3f9c2e17b48
Revises: d8b1f4c2a7e9
Create Date: 2026-09-16

The registration form drew a Personal email box and a LinkedIn box from the
day it was built and sent neither: the component's own docstring called them
"placeholders the backend does not yet take". On 2026-09-16 every box on that
form became compulsory (Specialization excepted), and a compulsory box whose
value is discarded is a lie told to every applicant, so the two columns land
here. NULLABLE, like `phone` beside them: `RegisterIn` is what requires them of
a NEW application, and the rows already in the queue predate the rule.

No backfill, for the same reason as every other one in this directory: there
is nothing honest to write. The office asks the student for both on their
placement profile, and approval copies these across from now on.
